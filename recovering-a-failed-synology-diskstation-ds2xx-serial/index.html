For 12 hours. The next morning, the device was dead, with the blue blink of death).\nWas it the new firmware? Or maybe a disk crash? Who knows.\nI followed the basic tests recommended by Synology: remove both disks, turn it on and wait 30s for a long beep. Beeeeeep. Great, the motherboard is still functional. It also responded to ping and showed up on DS Assistant, so processor and ethernet are also working fine.\nThe Synology DS NAS is basically an embedded Linux box, using md + lvm for RAID. Nothing is proprietary, so I mounted the disks on my Linux desktop and spent a few more hours cloning and re-building the RAID using a spare disk. Life is good.\nTill… it crashed again.\nThere was something wrong with the system partition, so I wanted to see inside the NAS, before the kernel finishes booting.\nThankfully, Synology folks already put a physical serial port in there. It’s not documented, but it’s not hard to find. You just have to open the case.\nDisclaimer: make sure you have backup! I am not responsible if you lose your data, void your warranty, burn down your house or kill your dog.\nStart by opening the case. Here’s a video with instructions [update: the original video is not available anymore, but here’s a similar one]. Be aware this may break the small internal hooks, and you’ll need to use tape or hot glue to put it back together (what’s wrong with manufacturers these days? What’s the problem with good old screws?) Inside the case, look for a 6-pin header, normally labeled JP2 (or COM1 on older models). The pins likely are: Pin Number Function Confirmed on Synology DS212+ 13.3V 2GND 4TX 6RX Now connect the pins 2, 4 and 6 (respectively GNS, TX, RX) to your USB-TTL 3v3 cable (if using the FTDI cable from Adafruit, it’ll be 1-black, 5-yellow, 4-orange. Make sure you don’t short-circuit any of the pins. These male-female jumper wires could be useful. Open your preferred terminal program (under Win ExtraPutty is the best in town), set to 115200, disable xon/xoff, and you’re all set. Now you can turn on your DS, and see all the beauty of what’s going on under the hood:\n__ __ _ _ | \\/ | __ _ _ ____ _____| | | | |\\/| |/ _` | '__\\ \\ / / _ \\ | | | | | | (_| | | \\ V / __/ | | |_| |_|\\__,_|_| \\_/ \\___|_|_| _ _ ____ _ | | | | | __ ) ___ ___ | |_ | | | |___| _ \\ / _ \\ / _ \\| __| | |_| |___| |_) | (_) | (_) | |_ \\___/ |____/ \\___/ \\___/ \\__| ** LOADER ** ** MARVELL BOARD: Synology Disk Station LE U-Boot 1.1.4 (Dec 2 2011 - 15:56:02) Marvell version: 3.5.9 U-Boot code: 00600000 -\u0026gt; 0067FFF0 BSS: -\u0026gt; 0068B3D4 Soc: 88F6282 A1CPU running @ 2000Mhz L2 running @ 500Mhz SysClock = 500Mhz , TClock = 200Mhz DRAM (DDR3) CAS Latency = 7 tRP = 7 tRAS = 20 tRCD=7 DRAM CS[0] base 0x00000000 size 256MB DRAM CS[1] base 0x10000000 size 256MB DRAM Total size 512MB 16bit width Addresses 8M - 0M are saved for the U-Boot usage.

The NetBSD folks posted a handy tutorial here.\nAll in all, the Synology Diskstation is a great NAS server, based on open standards, and very hacker friendly. Hope you never need to connect a serial console to yours, but it’s good to know it’s there, should you ever need it.\n",

<p>I thought I&rsquo;d post this here for anyone looking for help on troubleshooting a failed Synology Diskstation NAS.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a happy user of a Synology DS-212+. The software is robust and much better than my old DroboFS, and the fact that it is entirely open source is a big plus.</p>
<p>I recently upgraded the firmware to <a href="http://www.synology.com/releaseNote_enu/DS212+.php">DSM 2661</a>. Everything worked fine. For 12 hours. The next morning, the device was dead, with the <em>blue blink of death</em>).</p>

<li>Now connect the pins 2, 4 and 6 (respectively GNS, TX, RX) to your USB-TTL 3v3 cable (if using the <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/70">FTDI cable from Adafruit</a>, it&rsquo;ll be 1-black, 5-yellow, 4-orange. Make sure you don&rsquo;t short-circuit any of the pins. <a href="http://dx.com/p/male-to-female-dupont-breadboard-jumper-wires-for-arduino-40-piece-pack-20cm-length-146935">These male-female jumper wires</a> could be useful.</li>
<li>Open your preferred terminal program (under Win <a href="http://www.extraputty.com/">ExtraPutty</a> is the best in town), set to 115200, disable xon/xoff, and you&rsquo;re all set.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now you can turn on your DS, and see all the beauty of what&rsquo;s going on under the hood:</p>

<p><strong>Bonus tip</strong>: if you&rsquo;re really eager to void your warranty, you can hack U-Boot and load another operating system instead of Linux. The NetBSD folks posted a <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/ports/sandpoint/instSynology.html">handy tutorial here</a>.</p>
<p>All in all, the Synology Diskstation is a great NAS server, based on open standards, and very hacker friendly. Hope you never need to connect a serial console to yours, but it&rsquo;s good to know it&rsquo;s there, should you ever need it.</p>
