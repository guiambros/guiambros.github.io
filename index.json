It took me some time to make it work like I wanted (keyboard, extensions, application menu, etc), but I\u0026rsquo;m quite happy with everything. Or almost everything.\nOne thing I enjoyed over the years was the ability to customize my keyboard shortcuts. I have dozens of shotcuts - to center windows on my screen, to open programs, start and stop Spotify, to run macros, to log in to my remote servers, and so on.\nOne of my handy shortcuts is \u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;F1\u0026gt; to open an xterm with superuser, and \u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;F2\u0026gt; for regular user. I use custom xterm profiles, so I can easily check if I\u0026rsquo;m running under a privileged context by looking at the color of the window.\nThis worked well for years under Ubuntu 14.04 and Gnome 3.20, but stopped working with the upgrade to Bionic Beaver. More specifically, \u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;F1\u0026gt; is now System Help, with no way to change it.\n\u0026ldquo;No problem\u0026rdquo;, I thought; this can be easily adjusted in System Settings.\nNops.\nI searched around, and found other folks with the same problem, but no solution.\nI then decided to dug into the source code, and discovered the improbable: Gnome devs decided the help was so important that it deserved its own unique, hardcoded, and immutable shortcut. If you want to reassign it, you\u0026rsquo;re out of luck.\nAccording to gnome-settings-daemon changelog:\n=============== Version 3.21.90 =============== ... Media keys: - Add Super+F1 as a hardcoded shortcut for launching Help ... REALLY? What\u0026rsquo;s wrong with a default icon in the toolbar, or maybe a popup window when you boot for the first time? Also, does anyone really care about reading the basic documentation for\u0026hellip; a windows manager?\nI wasn\u0026rsquo;t convinced yet, but a closer look at the source code confirmed my fear: there it was: (file /gnome-settings-daemon/blob/master/plugins/media-keys/shortcuts-list.h):\n{ HELP_KEY, NULL, N_(\u0026#34;Help\u0026#34;), \u0026#34;\u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;F1\u0026#34;, GSD_ACTION_MODE_LAUNCHER }, So if you\u0026rsquo;re really determined to regain control of your \u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;F1\u0026gt;, there\u0026rsquo;s only one solution: to recompile gnome-settings-daemon, and replace the gsd-media-keys plugin. Spoiler alert: I\u0026rsquo;m glad to report that my patch was successful, but beware: getting the right dependencies and recompiling Gnome is not an easy feat. Keep reading if you\u0026rsquo;re interested in doing the same:\nDownload and install Gnome Builder Click on \u0026ldquo;Clone\u0026rdquo;, select a local directory (e.g., ~/Projects/) and use the official repo at https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-settings-daemon Open xterm, and enter cd ~/Projects/gnome-settings-daemon; git checkout tags/GNOME_SETTINGS_DAEMON_3_28_1 (you can check your exact version with gnome-shell --version. Check all tags available with git tag -l) Install all dependencies. These were the ones missing in my system, but YMMV: apt install libcolord-dev \\ libgeocode-glib-dev \\ gnome-desktop3-data \\ libgnome-desktop-3-dev \\ libgweather-3-dev \\ libcanberra-gtk3-dev \\ libgeoclue-2-dev \\ libnotify-dev \\ libpulse-mainloop-glib0 \\ libpulse-dev \\ gobject-introspection \\ libupower-glib-dev \\ libpolkit-gobject-1-dev \\ libasound2-dev \\ libgudev-1.0-dev \\ libwacom-dev \\ libnss3-dev \\ libcups2-dev \\ libnm-dev Patch the source code by editing ~/Projects/gnome-settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/shortcuts-list.h, and add a comment in front of the offender, like below (for Gnome 3.28.1 it is in line 69): // disabled! // { HELP_KEY, NULL, N_(\u0026#34;Help\u0026#34;), \u0026#34;\u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;F1\u0026#34;, GSD_ACTION_MODE_LAUNCHER }, Click [Rebuild] button in the Builder UI to compile (note: you need to click Rebuild, and not Build). You may want to turn off the deprecation warnings by editing meson.build and adding '-Wno-deprecated-declarations' to test_cflags = [...]; (line 70). If you installed all the dependencies correctly, you should have no warnings nor errors. Find the compiled binaries. You\u0026rsquo;re looking specifically for the plugin gsd-media-keys, so it\u0026rsquo;ll likely be in the directory ~/.var/app/org.gnome.Builder/cache/gnome-builder/projects/gnome-settings-daemon/builds/default-host-HEAD/plugins/media-keys cd ~/.var/app/org.gnome.Builder/cache/gnome-builder/projects/gnome-settings-daemon/builds/default-host-HEAD/plugins/media-keys ~ cp ./gsd-media-keys ~/gsd-media-keys.patched Before proceeding, you may want to inspect your binary to confirm it successfully linked with shared libraries by using ldd ~/gsd-media-keys.patched. In my case I had problems finding libgsd.so, so I solved it by adding the path to ldconfig (although the correct solution would be to fix this in the build system): sudo sh -c \u0026#39;echo \u0026#34;# gnome-settings-daemon\\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gnome-settings-daemon-3.0/\\n\u0026#34; \u0026gt; /etc/ld.so.conf.d/gnome-settings-daemon.conf\u0026#39; sudo ldconfig You\u0026rsquo;re now ready to install the patched gsd-media-keys binary in your system: cd /usr/lib/gnome-settings-daemon/ sudo mv ~/gsd-media-keys.patched . sudo strip -s ./gsd-media-keys.patched sudo mv gsd-media-keys gsd-media-keys.orig sudo ln -s gsd-media-keys.patched gsd-media-keys Log out or reboot, and you\u0026rsquo;re done! If all goes well, your system now should be running the gsd-media-keys plugin without the \u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;F1\u0026gt; hardcoded, so you can reassign to anything you like.\nIf anything goes wrong and you can\u0026rsquo;t log in, don\u0026rsquo;t despair. Simply open a console terminal by using \u0026lt;Ctrl\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;Alt\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;F2\u0026gt; and restore your original gsd-media-keys binary by doing:\ncd /usr/lib/gnome-settings-daemon/ sudo rm gsd-media-keys sudo ln -s gsd-media-keys.orig gsd-media-keys Use \u0026lt;Ctrl\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;Alt\u0026gt;\u0026lt;F1\u0026gt; to go back to Gnome and log in again. You can then inspect /var/log/syslog to understand what went wrong (search for \u0026ldquo;media-keys\u0026rdquo;).

The idea has been going around since the 19th century, even before the very first flight by Santos-Dumont (or Wright Brothers, depending on your bias). But it was The Jetsons who first brought the concept of flying cars to the masses. We grew up dreaming that one day we\u0026rsquo;d be able to get in our cars and fly straight to our destination - fast, safely, and traffic-free.\nThanks to Moore\u0026rsquo;s Law and the latest advances in engineering, we may be closer to flying cars than you think.\nAeroMobil is an innovative company from Slovakia, founded by Štefan Klein and Juraj Vaculik. Štefan, a well-known designer for Audi, Volkswagen and BMW, has been pursuing this idea for more than two decades. Juraj has a long and successful track record in advertising and as an investor. The two minds came together to create the company and make the dream a reality.\nDuring his talk at SXSW today, Juraj talked about the latest advances and their recent flying prototypes. As you can see on the two videos below, they made quite a progress between version 2.5 (early 2013) and 3.0 (late 2014).\nAeroMobil 2.5:\nAeroMobil 3.0: (note that Štefan himself test drives every prototype. He believes no one understand the machines better than him)\nDespite the progress, don\u0026rsquo;t expect to be driving - err.. flying - just yet. There are still several roadblocks (no pun intended) before mass adoption. They still need to figure out logistical challenges, like fueling stations, or grass strips next to roads for landing and take off. And change legislations, and define new testing procedures and certification. Or get people certified as pilots (yeah, don\u0026rsquo;t think your driver\u0026rsquo;s license will fly).\nBut with Google investing so heavily in self-driving cars, and SpaceX sending rockets to space, it\u0026rsquo;s not hard to imagine these efforts converging and eventually giving birth to self-driving flying cars. It might sound crazy at first, but there\u0026rsquo;s a good chance we\u0026rsquo;ll see it in our lifetime.

With 800+ sessions this year, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to get overwhelmed. But get over your FOMO, and enjoy the serendipity. You will miss many good sessions, and that\u0026rsquo;s OK. The best talk will be that one you didn\u0026rsquo;t plan, and just entered because your first option was full.\nSpeaking of crowded sessions: always have a plan B. Your first option will likely be full, so having a second/third option is always important.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t go to panels. Ever. There\u0026rsquo;s hardly enough time for one person to convey a good idea in under 60 minutes. 4 or 5 becomes a festival of shallow sound bites. You already have Twitter for those.\nSeek geeky and obscure talks. The less buzzwords on the description, the better. Extra points if the talk is by someone who is actually making things - rather than people talking about those who made it. I saw some unbelievably good sessions in the past which had less 20 participants in the audience.\nBring an extra battery pack. Your phone will die midday, even if you have an iPhone 6 Plus. Pack some extra juice.\nPlan your commute time between sessions. Some venues are 2 miles away from Austin Convention Center, and shuttles may take 15-30 min door-to-door. Try Lyft/Uber, or pedicabs. Or you can be ultra-hipster and apply for a loaner Boosted Board. I already secured mine!\nDriving is usually a bad idea. Parking is expensive, and you may want to have a beer or two (or six or ten). Get an Uber/Lyft, or use the official shuttles, but be prepared to spend one hour each way. And remind yourself next time to book your ticket the exact minute they go on sale, and enjoy the convenience of a hotel in walking distance.\nHave a good breakfast. You won\u0026rsquo;t eat much during the day, and you\u0026rsquo;re probably still recovering from last night.\nRSVPs are usually useless. Most of the parties don\u0026rsquo;t require RSVP, and use it just to collect email addresses. And the ones that do are not the ones you see on blogs. [EDIT: this used to be true, but it\u0026rsquo;s now starting to change. Many parties are now respecting RSVPs, and even many of the talks in the official program started to require reservation, so play safe and do your homework.]\nRemember: SXSW is a marathon, not a sprint. It\u0026rsquo;s 5 full days (double if you do Music/Film), so take time to enjoy yourself. It\u0026rsquo;s Spring, and there\u0026rsquo;s no better time to be in Austin.

The requirements are:\nMust be able to listen continuously Run on embedded ARM processors (particuarly Raspberry Pi and BeagleBone Black) Good accuracy on a limited set of words (English only) Decent performance, particularly on low-power CPUs My first thought was to use Google Speech API. The accuracy is great, and it\u0026rsquo;s reasonably fast. But it is also limited to only 50 calls per day, so it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t satisfy requirement #1. And I don\u0026rsquo;t like the idea of streaming all of my personal conversations to anyone. It\u0026rsquo;s already enough to have NSA listening to my phone calls\u0026hellip;\n(maybe it\u0026rsquo;s an option for the future, when implementing something with a physical push-button, like a Star Trek communicator device)\nSiriProxy is another neat hack, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work with iOS7/8 anymore. Apple will soon offer an official interface to Siri via its HomeKit program, but it\u0026rsquo;ll only work with licensed hardware. Likely not an option for hackers and personal projects.\nAfter some research, I found CMUSphinx project, which seems to be the best project in the area of voice recognition. PocketSphinx toolkit is the version you want for embedded CPUs, as it\u0026rsquo;s pure C, and rather portable.\nThe documentation is not very friendly, but once you get it going, it works well.\nThe first step is to download and install SphinxBase, followed by PocketSphinx. The README has instructions to compile and install, but it\u0026rsquo;s the basic\n./configure make make install By default it\u0026rsquo;ll install binaries to /usr/local/bin, and language models to /usr/local/share. Make sure you have swig and alsa drivers installed before starting (apt-get install swig alsa-base alsa-utils).\nOnce installed, you need to figure out which dictionary model you want to use. Just for testing, I created a dictionary with 106 words, based on the old Logo language (remember the Logo turtle?), like forward, backward, turn right, turn left, etc.\nBefore you can start training PocketSphinx, you\u0026rsquo;ll need an acoustic model. Sadly, the speech corpus (i.e., audio files with spoken words) used to train the models are usually closed source. So either you spend a couple of hours recording the voices (or using an4/Voxforge) to train your own model, or you\u0026rsquo;ll skip this entirely and just use some of the built-in models, accepting lower accuracy. Given my limited number of words in the dictionary, I decided to go with built in acoustic models.\nNext, you need to describe your Language Model - the words, grammar, and frequency of words that you want to recognize. This tutorial has more details. If you\u0026rsquo;re in a hurry and just want to get PocketSphinx going with a dictionary for your pre-defined words, save yourself some trouble and use the online lmtool. This webservice will allow you to upload your dictionary file (a simple ASCII file, with one sentence or word per line), and it\u0026rsquo;ll generate all the language models you need to run PocketSphinx.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a sample of my dictionary file:\nannounce answer ask back clipboard color copy count ... sentence set space square root stamp wait wait until when who word If you want to play with this dictionary, download these files here, and run:\npocketsphinx_continuous -lm lm/logo.lm -dict lm/logo.dic (note: if pocketsphinx is stuck at READY, it\u0026rsquo;s probably listening to the wrong hw device. Check where is the microphone attached via cat /proc/asound/cards, and add -adcdev plughw:X,0 to the line above, replacing X by the hardware id of your microphone).\npocketsphinx_continuous -lm lm/logo.lm -dict lm/logo.dic -adcdev plughw:2,0 Smartphones use all sorts of tricks to cancel the background noise, but that requires special hardware, so you\u0026rsquo;ll need a reasonable quiet environment. Otherwise the accuracy will suffer, depending on how large your dictionary is.\nAs you would expect, smaller dictionaries have much better accuracy. With a 100-word, I got 60-70% correct. After I reduced to a simple 15-words dictionary, I got virtually 100% match rate, even with some background noise and a non-American accent. Certainly enough for my projects.\nNext up: running this on a Raspberry Pi, installing a decent openair microphone, and testing overall performance when connected to a home automation system.

Before you realize, the night is gone.\nAfter spending a lot of time troubleshooting, I got to a deceptively simple arrangement, allowing .XCompose customizations in GTK+, QT, Aura (Chromium), and even plain terminal:\nJust use uim.\nGet rid of the default iBus, xim and everything else, and just go with uim.\nOf course, YMMV. I\u0026rsquo;m running Ubuntu 14.04 with Gnome 3.12.1, and using Chrome v38.0.2125.66 beta, and Sublime Text 3, build 3064. (oh the version inflation! Now tested with Ubuntu 20.04, Gnome 3.36, Chrome 81, Sublime Text 3 build 3210)\nThis also has the added benefit of allowing Unicode characters using Ctrl+Shift+U.\nNote that Sublime overrides the default keybinding for Ctrl+Shift+U with soft_redo (source ). You have two options here: 1) edit the default keybinding file - which is not recommended, as it\u0026rsquo;ll be overwritten on your next upgrade, or 2) use Ctrl+Shift+Alt+U. I\u0026rsquo;ve chosen the latter.\nDetailed instructions:\nInstall uim with sudo apt install uim Check which inputs you have installed with im-config -l. Keep only uim and xim (optional, but recommended); remove the rest with apt remove ibus etc Use im-config -n uim to set the default input to uim System Config, Regional Settings, select \u0026ldquo;US, intl with dead keys\u0026rdquo; System Config, Language Support, confirm you have uim under Keyboard input method system. If you removed the other input systems, you should have only uim/none here Add the following lines to /etc/environment: GTK_IM_MODULE=uim QT_IM_MODULE=uim xmodmap -e \u0026#39;keycode 48 = dead_acute dead_diaeresis dead_acute dead_diaeresis acute diaeresis\u0026#39; Download this .XCompose file and put in your home directory, using curl -L http://bit.ly/XCompose2 \u0026gt; ~/.XCompose Log out, log back in and enjoy!

Some say it\u0026rsquo;ll the the digital renaissance; others claim it\u0026rsquo;s the best thing to ever happen to the web, after the browser itself.\nThis video summarizes well the sentiment:\nThis is wrong.\nTen years from now we\u0026rsquo;ll look back and realize how much the new gTLDs have hurt us.\nFirst, most of the new gTLDs add little or no value. I bet we could live another 50 years without a .ninja, a .soy, .fail, .florist, or .loans.\nOthers will proclaim that the new gTLDs are useful, and point to domains like .nyc, .london, or .website, as examples of the \u0026ldquo;democratization\u0026rdquo; promoted by the new categories.\nBut these will be the exception rather than the rule. In practice the new gTLDS will force brands to spend millions of dollars to protect against cybersquatters rushing to claim new brand-related domains, amongst other threats.\nBefore you had to register your brand across a handful of TLDs. Now you have 1,400 more to worry about. That\u0026rsquo;s like a whack-a-mole game, but you\u0026rsquo;re outnumbered by hundreds of moles for each hand you have.\nAnd yet, this is not my main concern. Brands got screwed and will spend a ton of money, while domain registrars will be laughing all the way to the bank. Whatever, life will be fine.\nMy concern is a different one: the new gTLDs will accelerate the demise of the URI.\nWe already lost users to search. It\u0026rsquo;s more convenient to type \u0026ldquo;Brand\u0026rdquo; on the browser and let your search engine do the rest than typing \u0026ldquo;brand.com\u0026rdquo;. And on mobile the URL is already hidden from the user, as if it were an irrelevant technical implementation detail. Same on Safari on desktop.\nBut now multiply this situation by thousands of gTLDs, and you\u0026rsquo;ll have the perfect Paradox of Choice. Is it a .com, a .net, .cc? Nops. Keep going friend.\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s add to the mix the fact that a) most of the mobile traffic is already coming from native apps, and b) Apple is pushing to bury the URI, and c) Google is replacing everything by its omni-search. And we\u0026rsquo;re not even talking about Siri or voice-activated search. This will result in a very different world. My prediction: thanks to the new gTLDs, mobile apps and commercial players will have even more control than today, and URLs will be demoted to second-class citizens. They will still be there, but buried somewhere in the sub-menus of your browser, or the API of your Chrome extensions. Just like IP addresses; you know it\u0026rsquo;s there somewhere, but nobody cares.\nIn the name of find-ability and ease of use, we\u0026rsquo;ll live in an URL-less world. And commercial entities will be rewarded and profit from your traffic.\nI\u0026rsquo;m sure that\u0026rsquo;s not the web that Sir Tim Berners-Lee envisioned 25 years ago.\n","permalink":"https://wrgms.com/gtlds-and-the-death-of-urls/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eUnless you\u0026rsquo;ve been living under a rock, you\u0026rsquo;ve read \u003cem\u003ead nauseum\u003c/em\u003e about the overly optimistic predictions for the new gTLDs.

Here\u0026rsquo;s the piece of code from their version of OpenSSH 5.8p1, file session.c:\nvoid do_child(Session *s, const char *command) { ... #ifdef MY_ABC_HERE char szValue[8]; int RunSSH = 0; SSH_CMD SSHCmd = REQ_UNKNOWN; if (1 == GetKeyValue(\u0026#34;/etc/synoinfo.conf\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;runssh\u0026#34;, szValue, sizeof(szValue))) { if (strcasecmp(szValue, \u0026#34;yes\u0026#34;) == 0) { RunSSH = 1; } } if (IsSFTPReq(command)){ SSHCmd = REQ_SFTP; } else if (IsRsyncReq(command)){ SSHCmd = REQ_RSYNC; } else if (IsTimebkpRequest(command)){ SSHCmd = REQ_TIMEBKP; } else if (RunSSH \u0026amp;amp;\u0026amp;amp; IsAllowShell(pw)){ SSHCmd = REQ_SHELL; } else { goto Err; } if (REQ_RSYNC == SSHCmd) { pw = SYNOChgValForRsync(pw); } if (!SSHCanLogin(SSHCmd, pw)) { goto Err; } goto Pass; Err: fprintf(stderr, \u0026#34;Permission denied, please try again.\\n\u0026#34;); exit(1); Pass: #endif /* MY_ABC_HERE */ ... } And here is the IsAllowShell(pw):\nstatic int IsAllowShell(const struct passwd *pw) { struct passwd *pUnPrivilege = NULL; char *szUserName = NULL; if (!pw || !pw-\u0026amp;gt;pw_name) { return 0; } szUserName = pw-\u0026amp;gt;pw_name; if(!strcmp(szUserName, \u0026#34;root\u0026#34;) || !strcmp(szUserName, \u0026#34;admin\u0026#34;)){ return 1; } if (NULL != (pUnPrivilege = getpwnam(szUserName))){ if (!strcmp(pUnPrivilege-\u0026amp;gt;pw_shell, \u0026#34;/bin/sh\u0026#34;) || !strcmp(pUnPrivilege-\u0026amp;gt;pw_shell, \u0026#34;/bin/ash\u0026#34;)) { return 1; } } return 0; } Basically synology created a heavily customized version of OpenSSH, including a handful of hacks - e.g., additional checking before accepting a login to see if the SSH service is enabled within the web interface, or stripping special chars (;, |, \u0026lsquo;) from rsync commands, and\u0026hellip; wait for it\u0026hellip; blocking anyone other than root or admin from using any shell other than /bin/sh or /bin/ash.\nOnce identified the cause, the fix was easy: just remove the call to IsAllowShell(). Cross-compile, upload to the NAS, reboot and voilà, regular users can now use bash normally.\nThe hardest part was to get cross-compiling working properly. If there\u0026rsquo;s anyone interested, here\u0026rsquo;s my modified version of the Makefile. This was tested with OpenSSH-5.8p1 from DSM4.1 source code, branch 2636, on models with Marvell Kirkwood mv6281/mv6282 CPU (like DS212+), under Ubuntu 12.10 x64.\nBottom line: Synology did exactly what companies should not do: deviate from standards, for no reason. The result is ugly and unmaintainable code, and creates all sorts of headaches for users.\nThankfully there\u0026rsquo;s GPL to keep them (somewhat) open.\n","permalink":"https://wrgms.com/reverse-engineering-synology-openssh/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Chasing Synology\u0026rsquo;s OpenSSH bugs\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/content/images/2014/Feb/synology_openssh.png\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrying to use a non-standard shell in your Synology DS212+ NAS may be an exercise of frustration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m a bash-lover, and have a bunch of scripts to automate backups, so I wanted to set up default shell to /bin/bash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt worked well with root, but when a regular user tries to log in, the connection is terminated with \u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;Permission denied, please try again.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeird.

Or you simply don\u0026rsquo;t like the idea of having your port 23 open to the world for god-knows-how-long until a Synology tech support can look into your case.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ve probably tried telneting to your NAS. Maybe you\u0026rsquo;ve even tried opening the case and hacking the serial port, only to discover that you don\u0026rsquo;t have the root password. The DS Assistant password doesn\u0026rsquo;t work, and you exhausted all obvious guesses - blank, synopass, synology, password, admin, root, etc.\nWell, what about c12-0804? No, I didn\u0026rsquo;t make this up. This is today\u0026rsquo;s password.\nBut if you\u0026rsquo;re reading this a few days (or years) from now, too bad; it won\u0026rsquo;t work. Unless, of course, you wait until December 8th. Because the password repeats every year.\nBasically Synology hardcoded a modified login binary within the firmware that accepts an obfuscated password for root, which depends on the current date. (by the way, this isn\u0026rsquo;t the only thing Synology folks hardcoded in the firmware).\nThanks to GPL, Synology was forced to publish the original source code for the firmware. Based on the original correct_password.c code, I hacked a short snippet to generate the daily password.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the Synology Telnet password generator:\n#include \u0026amp;lt;stdlib.h\u0026amp;gt; #include \u0026amp;lt;time.h\u0026amp;gt; #include \u0026amp;lt;stdio.h\u0026amp;gt; void main() { struct timeval tvTime; struct tm tmOutput; gettimeofday(\u0026amp;amp;tvTime, 0); localtime_r(\u0026amp;amp;(tvTime.tv_sec), \u0026amp;amp;tmOutput); tmOutput.tm_mon += 1; printf(\u0026#34;password for today is: %x%02d-%02x%02d\\n\\n\u0026#34;, tmOutput.tm_mon, tmOutput.tm_mon, tmOutput.tm_mday, gcd(tmOutput.tm_mon, tmOutput.tm_mday)); } int gcd(int a, int b) { return (b?gcd(b,a%b):a); } Compile and run the code above with gcc. You can also use the excellent Codepad Repl.it to run the code online and get the password for today (no registration needed).\nBonus tip: if you\u0026rsquo;re curious how exactly the password is generated, here\u0026rsquo;s the algorithm:\n1st character = month in hexadecimal, lower case (1=Jan, \u0026hellip; , a=Oct, b=Nov, c=Dec) 2-3 = month in decimal, zero padded and starting in 1 (01, 02, 03, \u0026hellip;, 11, 12) 4 = dash 5-6 = day of the month in hex (01, 02 .., 0A, .., 1F) 7-8 = greatest common divisor between month and day, zero padded. This is always a number between 01 and 12. So, let\u0026rsquo;s say today is October 15, the password would be: a10-0f05 where a = month in hex, 10 = month in decimal, 0f = day in hex, 05 = greatest divisor between 10 and 15).\nIf you have trouble calculating the greatest common divisor (elementary math, anyone?), Wolfram Alpha is your friend.\nThis was tested on a Synology DS212+, with Marvell Kirkwood mv6282 chipset. It\u0026rsquo;s unlikely but still possible that different models use a different algorithm. YMMV, so always check the source code.\n[UPDATE 1: Several users reported that this works in many other models, including DS409, DS112j, etc. Please leave a comment with your model and firmware version.]\n[UPDATE 2: If it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work, it\u0026rsquo;s probably that your date is incorrect in the NAS. Per Patrick\u0026rsquo;s suggestion in the comments below, try \u0026ldquo;101-0101\u0026rdquo;, which is the password for Jan 01]\n","permalink":"https://wrgms.com/synologys-secret-telnet-password/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIf you have a Synology NAS and had some sort of disk crash in the past, you\u0026rsquo;ve probably encountered the famous \u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;Cannot format system partition\u0026rdquo;\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;Please configure your router to forward port 23 to DiskStation and contact Synology online support\u0026rdquo;\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, it sucks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt sucks even more when you know the disk is perfectly fine, and you still have hopes to recover your data.

The software is robust and much better than my old DroboFS, and the fact that it is entirely open source is a big plus.\nI recently upgraded the firmware to DSM 2661. Everything worked fine. For 12 hours. The next morning, the device was dead, with the blue blink of death).\nWas it the new firmware? Or maybe a disk crash? Who knows.\nI followed the basic tests recommended by Synology: remove both disks, turn it on and wait 30s for a long beep. Beeeeeep. Great, the motherboard is still functional. It also responded to ping and showed up on DS Assistant, so processor and ethernet are also working fine.\nThe Synology DS NAS is basically an embedded Linux box, using md + lvm for RAID. Nothing is proprietary, so I mounted the disks on my Linux desktop and spent a few more hours cloning and re-building the RAID using a spare disk. Life is good.\nTill\u0026hellip; it crashed again.\nThere was something wrong with the system partition, so I wanted to see inside the NAS, before the kernel finishes booting.\nThankfully, Synology folks already put a physical serial port in there. It\u0026rsquo;s not documented, but it\u0026rsquo;s not hard to find. You just have to open the case.\nDisclaimer: make sure you have backup! I am not responsible if you lose your data, void your warranty, burn down your house or kill your dog.\nStart by opening the case. Here\u0026rsquo;s a video with instructions [update: the original video is not available anymore, but here\u0026rsquo;s a similar one]. Be aware this may break the small internal hooks, and you\u0026rsquo;ll need to use tape or hot glue to put it back together (what\u0026rsquo;s wrong with manufacturers these days? What\u0026rsquo;s the problem with good old screws?) Inside the case, look for a 6-pin header, normally labeled JP2 (or COM1 on older models). The pins likely are: Pin Number Function Confirmed on Synology DS212+ \u0026nbsp; 13.3V 2GND 4TX 6RX Now connect the pins 2, 4 and 6 (respectively GNS, TX, RX) to your USB-TTL 3v3 cable (if using the FTDI cable from Adafruit, it\u0026rsquo;ll be 1-black, 5-yellow, 4-orange. Make sure you don\u0026rsquo;t short-circuit any of the pins. These male-female jumper wires could be useful. Open your preferred terminal program (under Win ExtraPutty is the best in town), set to 115200, disable xon/xoff, and you\u0026rsquo;re all set. Now you can turn on your DS, and see all the beauty of what\u0026rsquo;s going on under the hood:\n__ __ _ _ | \\/ | __ _ _ ____ _____| | | | |\\/| |/ _` | \u0026#39;__\\ \\ / / _ \\ | | | | | | (_| | | \\ V / __/ | | |_| |_|\\__,_|_| \\_/ \\___|_|_| _ _ ____ _ | | | | | __ ) ___ ___ | |_ | | | |___| _ \\ / _ \\ / _ \\| __| | |_| |___| |_) | (_) | (_) | |_ \\___/ |____/ \\___/ \\___/ \\__| ** LOADER ** ** MARVELL BOARD: Synology Disk Station LE U-Boot 1.1.4 (Dec 2 2011 - 15:56:02) Marvell version: 3.5.9 U-Boot code: 00600000 -\u0026amp;gt; 0067FFF0 BSS: -\u0026amp;gt; 0068B3D4 Soc: 88F6282 A1CPU running @ 2000Mhz L2 running @ 500Mhz SysClock = 500Mhz , TClock = 200Mhz DRAM (DDR3) CAS Latency = 7 tRP = 7 tRAS = 20 tRCD=7 DRAM CS[0] base 0x00000000 size 256MB DRAM CS[1] base 0x10000000 size 256MB DRAM Total size 512MB 16bit width Addresses 8M - 0M are saved for the U-Boot usage.

You\u0026rsquo;ll achieve the same conclusions, with 10% of the effort.\nOf course hindsight is a bitch \u0026ndash; or, like someone said on HN: \u0026quot;\u0026hellip;hindsight is a Glitch\u0026quot; :). Sometimes you can\u0026rsquo;t just hack an MVP together; you need a fully polished product. But I don\u0026rsquo;t think that\u0026rsquo;s the case here.\nIt seems to me they put too much effort on having a full product, and lost sight of the bigger picture. They repeated some of the same fatal mistakes others have done. For example, Lessons from Habitat outlines many of the same pitfalls, as seen by the creators of Lucasfilm in the mid-80\u0026rsquo;s. The entire paper is a great read, but one part that strikes me as relevant to this discussion:\n\u0026ldquo;While we find much of the work presently being done on elaborate interface technologies \u0026ndash; DataGloves, head-mounted displays, special-purpose rendering engines, and so on \u0026ndash; both exciting and promising, the almost mystical euphoria that currently seems to surround all this hardware is, in our opinion, both excessive and somewhat misplaced.\nWe can\u0026rsquo;t help having a nagging sense that it\u0026rsquo;s all a bit of a distraction from the really pressing issues.\n*At the core of our vision is the idea that cyberspace is necessarily a multiple-participant environment. It seems to us that the things that are important to the inhabitants of such an environment are the capabilities available to them, the characteristics of the other people they encounter there, and the ways these various participants can affect one another.\nBeyond a foundation set of communications capabilities, the details of the technology used to present this environment to its participants, while sexy and interesting, are of relatively peripheral concern.\u0026rdquo;\nKeep in mind the first Habitat was launched in 1986, almost 30 years ago, and ran in 64Kb on a Commodore64.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re now spoiled by Call Of Duty and hyper-realist NBA games. But there\u0026rsquo;s a point to be made that the success of an MMO game is not defined by its level of peripheral sophistication (be it design, cuteness, or head-mounted displays), but by the social experience, and how people interact with each other. Minecraft, with its blocky graphics and limited interactivity, is a prime example.\nGlitch isn\u0026rsquo;t alone in repeating these mistakes. Worlds Chat did the same two decades ago, being the first 3D world ever created. It was later replaced by The Palace. Later Philip Rosedale had his chance with Second Life, which exploded, then burst, and now is becoming cool again (and Philip is trying his hand again with High Fidelity).\nAnother issue with Glitch was its channel distribution. It\u0026rsquo;s challenging in 2012 to succeed with a web-only game, especially if you\u0026rsquo;re not anchored on Facebook. And Glitch was built in Flash (!), so it missed billions of 2-3 minutes slots of free time that people have when waiting for the train, bathroom, elevator. And it almost never sent any emails, so I guess they were expecting people to bookmark the site and keep coming back. Yeah, good luck with that\u0026hellip;\nIn the end of the day, the Glitch team deserve kudos for such a beautiful design. I just hope they can open source the code, so their work can inspire future designers and game developers.\nMany other comments on Hacker News.\n","permalink":"https://wrgms.com/glitch/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.glitch.com/\"\u003eGlitch\u003c/a\u003e, the beautiful massive multiplayer game with a pixel-perfect design, announced that they\u0026rsquo;ll be closing doors soon.

Sony. HBGary Hack. FBI. Paypal, Visa \u0026amp; MasterCard. Mubarak. Occupy Wall Street. SOPA/PIPA.\nAnonymous has been busy for the past few years. It started as juvenile pranks on 4chan\u0026rsquo;s boards, but grew and became a powerful mechanism against oppressive governments and unscrupulous corporations.\nIts trajectory was beautifully captured in the documentary \u0026ldquo;We Are Legion: The Story of the Hacktivists\u0026rdquo;, that will be released later this year. I had the pleasure to watch the premiere in Austin during SXSW, and I must say - it\u0026rsquo;s f..ing brilliant. The movie is still in post-production, so the theatrical release may be slightly different.\nWe also participated in an exclusive interview with the film director \u0026ldquo;Brian Knappenberger\u0026rdquo;, who was joined on stage by former Anonymous member Gregg Housh and two special guests Anon behind masks: one from Austin, and another just called Anonymous9000, connecting via Skype from an undisclosed location (and using a robotic voice changer). It was a surreal experience.\nTogether they gave a passionate and fascinating perspective of the evolution of Anonymous, its internal workings, and the journey since 4Chan to the present day. They discussed how the group went after the Church of Scientology, why they hacked HBGary, discussed the release of confidential data of Sony customers, and how lately they\u0026rsquo;ve started to engage in social movements around freedom, Occupy Wall Street, the Arab Spring, and the support to Wikileaks\u0026rsquo; founder, Julian Assange.\nA few highlights of the session, in no particular order:\nsome Anons don\u0026rsquo;t agree with the dump of personal information (like in Sony\u0026rsquo;s case). But a few radical sub-groups - like Lulzsec - have a different opinion, and believe the press only pays attention when something concrete happens. Ironically, one of the most vocal supporters of dumping personal data was Sabu - which was revealed last week to be an FBI informant since June 2011. Conflict of interest, maybe?\nAnons in general don\u0026rsquo;t support attacking the press, as they believe in freedom of expression themselves (even when it is press against Anonymous). Some may disagree. Others simply don\u0026rsquo;t care; they\u0026rsquo;re in for the lulz, and accuse others of being moralfags.

If you\u0026rsquo;re not one of the 12,000 people already using the service (that\u0026rsquo;s the number Andrea gave during the talk), well\u0026hellip; you should give it a try, because everyone is talking about it. Yeah, I live in the echo chamber, I know.\nGlancee, like its competitors Highlight, Sonar, Banjo, are all exploring the new niche of location social discovery - some sort of Match.com-meets-LinkedIn. Unproven territory, but sounds promising (albeit somewhat dystopian) to me. Andrea spoke about the current status of social discovery apps and the different approaches taken by each player. He also mentioned the incredible growth (hard to see 12,000 as incredible, but startup founders have to drink their own Kool-Aid), particularly with all the buzz around SXSW.\nBut to me the most interesting tidbit was the concept of monetizing the service via Spatial Analysis.\nHe didn\u0026rsquo;t elaborate much, so let me speculate a bit here. Consider that you have a device on your pocket that is connected to Facebook (i.e. knows everything about your attitudinal behavior - including Likes, affinity with brands, reach, friends). You have Glancee installed, and as such it is constantly broadcasting your current geolocation. Every. Single. Minute. Like Google Latitude, but with a Facebook social layer on top of it.\nNot only it knows who you are and what you like, but also where you\u0026rsquo;ve been, where you work, live, play, study, shop, your the preferred gas station, and countries you\u0026rsquo;ve travelled.\nAll this leads to a level of geospatial analysis never seen before, using all your social graph as an extra dimension. You could plot heatmaps showing location of people that liked your brand on FB, and use to optimize out-of-home media placement. Or monitor the consumers of a competitor brand when planning new physical stores. Basically it\u0026rsquo;s any marketer\u0026rsquo;s dream come true.\nOf course, it has just one small problem: it needs permission, and critical mass. You need tens of millions of users using the service, in order to have a meaningful representation.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why Andreas was so adamant when I asked him about his number one goal: \u0026ldquo;Growth. And fast\u0026rdquo;.\nUpdate 2012-05-04: it seems Facebook may agree with me here \u0026ndash; Facebook just announced they\u0026rsquo;re acquiring Glancee.

But despite recent progress with Content Network and YouTube, the marketing community still see the search giant as a way to drive conversion at the bottom of the funnel. In order to move to the next level, Google has to prove they can create emotional connections with consumers.\nEnter Project Re:Brief, just announced during SXSW.\nAccording to Aman Govil, Google\u0026rsquo;s Product Marketing Manager, the idea was to \u0026ldquo;re-imagine iconic campaigns of 4 classic global brands through the lenses of modern technology\u0026rdquo;. The project aims to be a benchmark of what is possible when you have the right idea and the perfect balance between creativity \u0026amp; technology.\nThe brands were carefully selected: Coca-Cola with Hilltop, Volvo with Drive it like you hate it, Avis We try harder, and Alka-Seltzer I can\u0026rsquo;t believe I ate the whole thing. The secret sauce was that they brought back from retirement the original creators of these 4 campaigns, and paired them with digital creatives, so they could re-imagine their original creations, leveraging today\u0026rsquo;s technology.\nIt was fascinating to see people like Harvey Gabor (Coca-Cola\u0026rsquo;s Hilltop, 1971) working with a bunch of twenty-something, and discovering how to use touch screens, mobile, realtime web.\nI had the opportunity to chat with Aman and Drew (the global creative director for the new campaigns) to understand how they pulled it together. Surprisingly, each project took just 2-3 months, and were executed with a relatively small budget (\u0026ldquo;Less than a TV spots\u0026rdquo;, told me Drew). Seems the advertisers were initially resistant to touch iconic pieces like Hilltop, but eventually understood the spirit of the project, and loved the opportunity to work with the original creators.\nWhat is even more fascinating is that not a single can of Coke or Alka-Seltzer was sold because this initiative. Google pulled this off not to help their clients sell more, but to help themseves. The target audience was marketers and agencies, hoping they would talk, comment, write blog posts. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t get more meta than this.\nCheck out more at www.projectrebrief.com, and look for the documentary later this year.\nUpdate 2012-06-22: the full documentary is now available on YouTube.\n","permalink":"https://wrgms.com/rebrief/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/content/images/2014/Feb/google_rebrief-1.png\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the past years Google has been trying to go beyond search, diversifying their revenue sources.

It took me some time to make it work like I wanted (keyboard, extensions, application menu, etc), but I\u0026rsquo;m quite happy with everything. Or almost everything.\nOne thing I enjoyed over the years was the ability to customize my keyboard shortcuts. I have dozens of shotcuts - to center windows on my screen, to open programs, start and stop Spotify, to run macros, to log in to my remote servers, and so on.\nOne of my handy shortcuts is \u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;F1\u0026gt; to open an xterm with superuser, and \u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;F2\u0026gt; for regular user. I use custom xterm profiles, so I can easily check if I\u0026rsquo;m running under a privileged context by looking at the color of the window.\nThis worked well for years under Ubuntu 14.04 and Gnome 3.20, but stopped working with the upgrade to Bionic Beaver. More specifically, \u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;F1\u0026gt; is now System Help, with no way to change it.\n\u0026ldquo;No problem\u0026rdquo;, I thought; this can be easily adjusted in System Settings.\nNops.\nI searched around, and found other folks with the same problem, but no solution.\nI then decided to dug into the source code, and discovered the improbable: Gnome devs decided the help was so important that it deserved its own unique, hardcoded, and immutable shortcut. If you want to reassign it, you\u0026rsquo;re out of luck.\nAccording to gnome-settings-daemon changelog:\n=============== Version 3.21.90 =============== ... Media keys: - Add Super+F1 as a hardcoded shortcut for launching Help ... REALLY? What\u0026rsquo;s wrong with a default icon in the toolbar, or maybe a popup window when you boot for the first time? Also, does anyone really care about reading the basic documentation for\u0026hellip; a windows manager?\nI wasn\u0026rsquo;t convinced yet, but a closer look at the source code confirmed my fear: there it was: (file /gnome-settings-daemon/blob/master/plugins/media-keys/shortcuts-list.h):\n{ HELP_KEY, NULL, N_(\u0026#34;Help\u0026#34;), \u0026#34;\u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;F1\u0026#34;, GSD_ACTION_MODE_LAUNCHER }, So if you\u0026rsquo;re really determined to regain control of your \u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;F1\u0026gt;, there\u0026rsquo;s only one solution: to recompile gnome-settings-daemon, and replace the gsd-media-keys plugin. Spoiler alert: I\u0026rsquo;m glad to report that my patch was successful, but beware: getting the right dependencies and recompiling Gnome is not an easy feat. Keep reading if you\u0026rsquo;re interested in doing the same:\nDownload and install Gnome Builder Click on \u0026ldquo;Clone\u0026rdquo;, select a local directory (e.g., ~/Projects/) and use the official repo at https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-settings-daemon Open xterm, and enter cd ~/Projects/gnome-settings-daemon; git checkout tags/GNOME_SETTINGS_DAEMON_3_28_1 (you can check your exact version with gnome-shell --version. Check all tags available with git tag -l) Install all dependencies. These were the ones missing in my system, but YMMV: apt install libcolord-dev \\ libgeocode-glib-dev \\ gnome-desktop3-data \\ libgnome-desktop-3-dev \\ libgweather-3-dev \\ libcanberra-gtk3-dev \\ libgeoclue-2-dev \\ libnotify-dev \\ libpulse-mainloop-glib0 \\ libpulse-dev \\ gobject-introspection \\ libupower-glib-dev \\ libpolkit-gobject-1-dev \\ libasound2-dev \\ libgudev-1.0-dev \\ libwacom-dev \\ libnss3-dev \\ libcups2-dev \\ libnm-dev Patch the source code by editing ~/Projects/gnome-settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/shortcuts-list.h, and add a comment in front of the offender, like below (for Gnome 3.28.1 it is in line 69): // disabled! // { HELP_KEY, NULL, N_(\u0026#34;Help\u0026#34;), \u0026#34;\u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;F1\u0026#34;, GSD_ACTION_MODE_LAUNCHER }, Click [Rebuild] button in the Builder UI to compile (note: you need to click Rebuild, and not Build). You may want to turn off the deprecation warnings by editing meson.build and adding '-Wno-deprecated-declarations' to test_cflags = [...]; (line 70). If you installed all the dependencies correctly, you should have no warnings nor errors. Find the compiled binaries. You\u0026rsquo;re looking specifically for the plugin gsd-media-keys, so it\u0026rsquo;ll likely be in the directory ~/.var/app/org.gnome.Builder/cache/gnome-builder/projects/gnome-settings-daemon/builds/default-host-HEAD/plugins/media-keys cd ~/.var/app/org.gnome.Builder/cache/gnome-builder/projects/gnome-settings-daemon/builds/default-host-HEAD/plugins/media-keys ~ cp ./gsd-media-keys ~/gsd-media-keys.patched Before proceeding, you may want to inspect your binary to confirm it successfully linked with shared libraries by using ldd ~/gsd-media-keys.patched. In my case I had problems finding libgsd.so, so I solved it by adding the path to ldconfig (although the correct solution would be to fix this in the build system): sudo sh -c \u0026#39;echo \u0026#34;# gnome-settings-daemon\\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gnome-settings-daemon-3.0/\\n\u0026#34; \u0026gt; /etc/ld.so.conf.d/gnome-settings-daemon.conf\u0026#39; sudo ldconfig You\u0026rsquo;re now ready to install the patched gsd-media-keys binary in your system: cd /usr/lib/gnome-settings-daemon/ sudo mv ~/gsd-media-keys.patched . sudo strip -s ./gsd-media-keys.patched sudo mv gsd-media-keys gsd-media-keys.orig sudo ln -s gsd-media-keys.patched gsd-media-keys Log out or reboot, and you\u0026rsquo;re done! If all goes well, your system now should be running the gsd-media-keys plugin without the \u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;F1\u0026gt; hardcoded, so you can reassign to anything you like.\nIf anything goes wrong and you can\u0026rsquo;t log in, don\u0026rsquo;t despair. Simply open a console terminal by using \u0026lt;Ctrl\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;Alt\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;F2\u0026gt; and restore your original gsd-media-keys binary by doing:\ncd /usr/lib/gnome-settings-daemon/ sudo rm gsd-media-keys sudo ln -s gsd-media-keys.orig gsd-media-keys Use \u0026lt;Ctrl\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;Alt\u0026gt;\u0026lt;F1\u0026gt; to go back to Gnome and log in again. You can then inspect /var/log/syslog to understand what went wrong (search for \u0026ldquo;media-keys\u0026rdquo;). It\u0026rsquo;s likely that you had problems with the dynamic libraries in step 8 above.\n","permalink":"https://wrgms.com/fixing-gnome-3-2x-hardcoded-superf1-shortcut/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eUbuntu 18.04 LTS is finally out, and with it you now have Gnome out of the box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve been using Gnome for several years, and have enjoyed its minimalism.

You may smile. But it will come…” [Henry Ford, 1940]\nFlying cars are not something new. The idea has been going around since the 19th century, even before the very first flight by Santos-Dumont (or Wright Brothers, depending on your bias). But it was The Jetsons who first brought the concept of flying cars to the masses. We grew up dreaming that one day we\u0026rsquo;d be able to get in our cars and fly straight to our destination - fast, safely, and traffic-free.\nThanks to Moore\u0026rsquo;s Law and the latest advances in engineering, we may be closer to flying cars than you think.\nAeroMobil is an innovative company from Slovakia, founded by Štefan Klein and Juraj Vaculik. Štefan, a well-known designer for Audi, Volkswagen and BMW, has been pursuing this idea for more than two decades. Juraj has a long and successful track record in advertising and as an investor. The two minds came together to create the company and make the dream a reality.\nDuring his talk at SXSW today, Juraj talked about the latest advances and their recent flying prototypes. As you can see on the two videos below, they made quite a progress between version 2.5 (early 2013) and 3.0 (late 2014).\nAeroMobil 2.5:\nAeroMobil 3.0: (note that Štefan himself test drives every prototype. He believes no one understand the machines better than him)\nDespite the progress, don\u0026rsquo;t expect to be driving - err.. flying - just yet. There are still several roadblocks (no pun intended) before mass adoption. They still need to figure out logistical challenges, like fueling stations, or grass strips next to roads for landing and take off. And change legislations, and define new testing procedures and certification. Or get people certified as pilots (yeah, don\u0026rsquo;t think your driver\u0026rsquo;s license will fly).\nBut with Google investing so heavily in self-driving cars, and SpaceX sending rockets to space, it\u0026rsquo;s not hard to imagine these efforts converging and eventually giving birth to self-driving flying cars. It might sound crazy at first, but there\u0026rsquo;s a good chance we\u0026rsquo;ll see it in our lifetime. AeroMobil may be in the exact spot that Paul Graham calls a Frighteningly Ambitious Startup Idea.\nCrazy? Yes.

With 800+ sessions this year, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to get overwhelmed. But get over your FOMO, and enjoy the serendipity. You will miss many good sessions, and that\u0026rsquo;s OK. The best talk will be that one you didn\u0026rsquo;t plan, and just entered because your first option was full.\nSpeaking of crowded sessions: always have a plan B. Your first option will likely be full, so having a second/third option is always important.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t go to panels. Ever. There\u0026rsquo;s hardly enough time for one person to convey a good idea in under 60 minutes. 4 or 5 becomes a festival of shallow sound bites. You already have Twitter for those.\nSeek geeky and obscure talks. The less buzzwords on the description, the better. Extra points if the talk is by someone who is actually making things - rather than people talking about those who made it. I saw some unbelievably good sessions in the past which had less 20 participants in the audience.\nBring an extra battery pack. Your phone will die midday, even if you have an iPhone 6 Plus. Pack some extra juice.\nPlan your commute time between sessions. Some venues are 2 miles away from Austin Convention Center, and shuttles may take 15-30 min door-to-door. Try Lyft/Uber, or pedicabs. Or you can be ultra-hipster and apply for a loaner Boosted Board. I already secured mine!\nDriving is usually a bad idea. Parking is expensive, and you may want to have a beer or two (or six or ten). Get an Uber/Lyft, or use the official shuttles, but be prepared to spend one hour each way. And remind yourself next time to book your ticket the exact minute they go on sale, and enjoy the convenience of a hotel in walking distance.\nHave a good breakfast. You won\u0026rsquo;t eat much during the day, and you\u0026rsquo;re probably still recovering from last night.\nRSVPs are usually useless. Most of the parties don\u0026rsquo;t require RSVP, and use it just to collect email addresses. And the ones that do are not the ones you see on blogs. [EDIT: this used to be true, but it\u0026rsquo;s now starting to change. Many parties are now respecting RSVPs, and even many of the talks in the official program started to require reservation, so play safe and do your homework.]\nRemember: SXSW is a marathon, not a sprint. It\u0026rsquo;s 5 full days (double if you do Music/Film), so take time to enjoy yourself. It\u0026rsquo;s Spring, and there\u0026rsquo;s no better time to be in Austin.

The requirements are:\nMust be able to listen continuously Run on embedded ARM processors (particuarly Raspberry Pi and BeagleBone Black) Good accuracy on a limited set of words (English only) Decent performance, particularly on low-power CPUs My first thought was to use Google Speech API. The accuracy is great, and it\u0026rsquo;s reasonably fast. But it is also limited to only 50 calls per day, so it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t satisfy requirement #1. And I don\u0026rsquo;t like the idea of streaming all of my personal conversations to anyone. It\u0026rsquo;s already enough to have NSA listening to my phone calls\u0026hellip;\n(maybe it\u0026rsquo;s an option for the future, when implementing something with a physical push-button, like a Star Trek communicator device)\nSiriProxy is another neat hack, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work with iOS7/8 anymore. Apple will soon offer an official interface to Siri via its HomeKit program, but it\u0026rsquo;ll only work with licensed hardware. Likely not an option for hackers and personal projects.\nAfter some research, I found CMUSphinx project, which seems to be the best project in the area of voice recognition. PocketSphinx toolkit is the version you want for embedded CPUs, as it\u0026rsquo;s pure C, and rather portable.\nThe documentation is not very friendly, but once you get it going, it works well.\nThe first step is to download and install SphinxBase, followed by PocketSphinx. The README has instructions to compile and install, but it\u0026rsquo;s the basic\n./configure make make install By default it\u0026rsquo;ll install binaries to /usr/local/bin, and language models to /usr/local/share. Make sure you have swig and alsa drivers installed before starting (apt-get install swig alsa-base alsa-utils).\nOnce installed, you need to figure out which dictionary model you want to use. Just for testing, I created a dictionary with 106 words, based on the old Logo language (remember the Logo turtle?), like forward, backward, turn right, turn left, etc.\nBefore you can start training PocketSphinx, you\u0026rsquo;ll need an acoustic model. Sadly, the speech corpus (i.e., audio files with spoken words) used to train the models are usually closed source. So either you spend a couple of hours recording the voices (or using an4/Voxforge) to train your own model, or you\u0026rsquo;ll skip this entirely and just use some of the built-in models, accepting lower accuracy. Given my limited number of words in the dictionary, I decided to go with built in acoustic models.\nNext, you need to describe your Language Model - the words, grammar, and frequency of words that you want to recognize. This tutorial has more details. If you\u0026rsquo;re in a hurry and just want to get PocketSphinx going with a dictionary for your pre-defined words, save yourself some trouble and use the online lmtool. This webservice will allow you to upload your dictionary file (a simple ASCII file, with one sentence or word per line), and it\u0026rsquo;ll generate all the language models you need to run PocketSphinx.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a sample of my dictionary file:\nannounce answer ask back clipboard color copy count ... sentence set space square root stamp wait wait until when who word If you want to play with this dictionary, download these files here, and run:\npocketsphinx_continuous -lm lm/logo.lm -dict lm/logo.dic (note: if pocketsphinx is stuck at READY, it\u0026rsquo;s probably listening to the wrong hw device. Check where is the microphone attached via cat /proc/asound/cards, and add -adcdev plughw:X,0 to the line above, replacing X by the hardware id of your microphone).\npocketsphinx_continuous -lm lm/logo.lm -dict lm/logo.dic -adcdev plughw:2,0 Smartphones use all sorts of tricks to cancel the background noise, but that requires special hardware, so you\u0026rsquo;ll need a reasonable quiet environment. Otherwise the accuracy will suffer, depending on how large your dictionary is.\nAs you would expect, smaller dictionaries have much better accuracy. With a 100-word, I got 60-70% correct. After I reduced to a simple 15-words dictionary, I got virtually 100% match rate, even with some background noise and a non-American accent. Certainly enough for my projects.\nNext up: running this on a Raspberry Pi, installing a decent openair microphone, and testing overall performance when connected to a home automation system.

It\u0026rsquo;s a shame that Linux keyboard is still horribly broken by default (some may say it\u0026rsquo;s by design; no, it\u0026rsquo;s not).\nIt has been asked before, but most answers will point you to use xim, which will open another can of worms.

Some say it\u0026rsquo;ll the the digital renaissance; others claim it\u0026rsquo;s the best thing to ever happen to the web, after the browser itself.\nThis video summarizes well the sentiment:\nThis is wrong.\nTen years from now we\u0026rsquo;ll look back and realize how much the new gTLDs have hurt us.\nFirst, most of the new gTLDs add little or no value. I bet we could live another 50 years without a .ninja, a .soy, .fail, .florist, or .loans.\nOthers will proclaim that the new gTLDs are useful, and point to domains like .nyc, .london, or .website, as examples of the \u0026ldquo;democratization\u0026rdquo; promoted by the new categories.\nBut these will be the exception rather than the rule. In practice the new gTLDS will force brands to spend millions of dollars to protect against cybersquatters rushing to claim new brand-related domains, amongst other threats.\nBefore you had to register your brand across a handful of TLDs. Now you have 1,400 more to worry about. That\u0026rsquo;s like a whack-a-mole game, but you\u0026rsquo;re outnumbered by hundreds of moles for each hand you have.\nAnd yet, this is not my main concern. Brands got screwed and will spend a ton of money, while domain registrars will be laughing all the way to the bank. Whatever, life will be fine.\nMy concern is a different one: the new gTLDs will accelerate the demise of the URI.\nWe already lost users to search. It\u0026rsquo;s more convenient to type \u0026ldquo;Brand\u0026rdquo; on the browser and let your search engine do the rest than typing \u0026ldquo;brand.com\u0026rdquo;. And on mobile the URL is already hidden from the user, as if it were an irrelevant technical implementation detail. Same on Safari on desktop.\nBut now multiply this situation by thousands of gTLDs, and you\u0026rsquo;ll have the perfect Paradox of Choice. Is it a .com, a .net, .cc? Nops. Keep going friend.\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s add to the mix the fact that a) most of the mobile traffic is already coming from native apps, and b) Apple is pushing to bury the URI, and c) Google is replacing everything by its omni-search. And we\u0026rsquo;re not even talking about Siri or voice-activated search. This will result in a very different world. My prediction: thanks to the new gTLDs, mobile apps and commercial players will have even more control than today, and URLs will be demoted to second-class citizens. They will still be there, but buried somewhere in the sub-menus of your browser, or the API of your Chrome extensions. Just like IP addresses; you know it\u0026rsquo;s there somewhere, but nobody cares.\nIn the name of find-ability and ease of use, we\u0026rsquo;ll live in an URL-less world. And commercial entities will be rewarded and profit from your traffic.\nI\u0026rsquo;m sure that\u0026rsquo;s not the web that Sir Tim Berners-Lee envisioned 25 years ago.\n","permalink":"https://wrgms.com/gtlds-and-the-death-of-urls/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eUnless you\u0026rsquo;ve been living under a rock, you\u0026rsquo;ve read \u003cem\u003ead nauseum\u003c/em\u003e about the overly optimistic predictions for the new gTLDs.

Wrong.\nBut this time I was the one to blame.\nAfter solving the conflict with bash, I changed /etc/passwd user shell to /bin/bash. The only problem is that Synology wipes the system partition during firmware upgrades, so when I upgraded to DSM 4.1.2668, my custom `/bin/bash``was gone. Of course this locked me out of the system. No SSH, SCP or FTP. Great.\nAfter a few moments of panic, I remembered I still had the serial console. So I could put Linux in single user mode, and drop into recovery mode.\nSo if you\u0026rsquo;re ever in a similar situation, here\u0026rsquo;s how to fix it:\n1. First, you need a serial console.\n2. During U-Boot, press any key to cancel the automatic kernel boot (Hit any key to stop autoboot).\n3. Enter printenv to check the environment variables. Search for bootargs and bootm variables (they will be different on your system, so do NOT copy and paste from mine, unless you have a Synology DS212+ with the same DSM).\n4. Append reboot=cold,hard emergency init=/bin/sh to the end of bootargs variable. In my case, this is what I used:\nsetenv bootargs \u0026#39;console=ttyS0,115200 ip=off initrd=0x00800040,4M root=/dev/md0 rw syno_hw_version=DS212pv20 ihd_num=2 netif_num=1 esata_7042=1 reboot=cold,hard emergency init=/bin/sh\u0026#39; (again, your parameters will likely be different, so don\u0026rsquo;t copy and paste)\n5. Boot your kernel, with\nbootm F8080000 F8280000 Now your Synology should be happily botting in single user mode, ignoring /etc/passwd and dropping you to a plain shell. Do what you have to do to fix the system, and reboot.\nYou can also use these steps to recover your system partition from a crash or other problem.\n","permalink":"https://wrgms.com/entering-single-user-mode-on-a-synology/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"alt text\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/content/images/2013/01/synology.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hope this will be my last post about Synology for a while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter dealing for a few weeks with an \u003ca href=\"http://forum.synology.com/enu/viewtopic.php?f=221\u0026amp;t=59808\u0026amp;start=45#p232455\"\u003eunstable environment\u003c/a\u003e, then \u003ca href=\"/recovering-a-failed-synology-diskstation-ds2xx-serial\"\u003ehacking a serial console\u003c/a\u003e to troubleshoot, then \u003ca href=\"/synologys-secret-telnet-password/\"\u003ecracking the secret recovery telnet password\u003c/a\u003e just for fun, and finally solving the \u003ca href=\"http://serverfault.com/questions/458553/cant-log-in-via-ssh-to-any-accounts-set-to-use-bin-bash-as-a-default-shell/\"\u003eweird mistery\u003c/a\u003e of SSH \u003ca href=\"/reverse-engineering-synology-openssh\"\u003enot accepting /bin/bash as default shell\u003c/a\u003e, I thought I finally had a stable environment.

The user has to be called \u0026ldquo;root\u0026rdquo;.\nWHAAAT?\nThankfully, Synology uses a modified Linux distribution, so they publish the code under GPL.\nAfter a couple of hours looking at the OpenSSH source code, things became pretty obvious. Here\u0026rsquo;s the piece of code from their version of OpenSSH 5.8p1, file session.c:\nvoid do_child(Session *s, const char *command) { ... #ifdef MY_ABC_HERE char szValue[8]; int RunSSH = 0; SSH_CMD SSHCmd = REQ_UNKNOWN; if (1 == GetKeyValue(\u0026#34;/etc/synoinfo.conf\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;runssh\u0026#34;, szValue, sizeof(szValue))) { if (strcasecmp(szValue, \u0026#34;yes\u0026#34;) == 0) { RunSSH = 1; } } if (IsSFTPReq(command)){ SSHCmd = REQ_SFTP; } else if (IsRsyncReq(command)){ SSHCmd = REQ_RSYNC; } else if (IsTimebkpRequest(command)){ SSHCmd = REQ_TIMEBKP; } else if (RunSSH \u0026amp;amp;\u0026amp;amp; IsAllowShell(pw)){ SSHCmd = REQ_SHELL; } else { goto Err; } if (REQ_RSYNC == SSHCmd) { pw = SYNOChgValForRsync(pw); } if (!SSHCanLogin(SSHCmd, pw)) { goto Err; } goto Pass; Err: fprintf(stderr, \u0026#34;Permission denied, please try again.\\n\u0026#34;); exit(1); Pass: #endif /* MY_ABC_HERE */ ... } And here is the IsAllowShell(pw):\nstatic int IsAllowShell(const struct passwd *pw) { struct passwd *pUnPrivilege = NULL; char *szUserName = NULL; if (!pw || !pw-\u0026amp;gt;pw_name) { return 0; } szUserName = pw-\u0026amp;gt;pw_name; if(!strcmp(szUserName, \u0026#34;root\u0026#34;) || !strcmp(szUserName, \u0026#34;admin\u0026#34;)){ return 1; } if (NULL != (pUnPrivilege = getpwnam(szUserName))){ if (!strcmp(pUnPrivilege-\u0026amp;gt;pw_shell, \u0026#34;/bin/sh\u0026#34;) || !strcmp(pUnPrivilege-\u0026amp;gt;pw_shell, \u0026#34;/bin/ash\u0026#34;)) { return 1; } } return 0; } Basically synology created a heavily customized version of OpenSSH, including a handful of hacks - e.g., additional checking before accepting a login to see if the SSH service is enabled within the web interface, or stripping special chars (;, |, \u0026lsquo;) from rsync commands, and\u0026hellip; wait for it\u0026hellip; blocking anyone other than root or admin from using any shell other than /bin/sh or /bin/ash.\nOnce identified the cause, the fix was easy: just remove the call to IsAllowShell(). Cross-compile, upload to the NAS, reboot and voilà, regular users can now use bash normally.\nThe hardest part was to get cross-compiling working properly.

Or you simply don\u0026rsquo;t like the idea of having your port 23 open to the world for god-knows-how-long until a Synology tech support can look into your case.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ve probably tried telneting to your NAS. Maybe you\u0026rsquo;ve even tried opening the case and hacking the serial port, only to discover that you don\u0026rsquo;t have the root password. The DS Assistant password doesn\u0026rsquo;t work, and you exhausted all obvious guesses - blank, synopass, synology, password, admin, root, etc.\nWell, what about c12-0804? No, I didn\u0026rsquo;t make this up. This is today\u0026rsquo;s password.\nBut if you\u0026rsquo;re reading this a few days (or years) from now, too bad; it won\u0026rsquo;t work. Unless, of course, you wait until December 8th. Because the password repeats every year.\nBasically Synology hardcoded a modified login binary within the firmware that accepts an obfuscated password for root, which depends on the current date. (by the way, this isn\u0026rsquo;t the only thing Synology folks hardcoded in the firmware).\nThanks to GPL, Synology was forced to publish the original source code for the firmware. Based on the original correct_password.c code, I hacked a short snippet to generate the daily password.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the Synology Telnet password generator:\n#include \u0026amp;lt;stdlib.h\u0026amp;gt; #include \u0026amp;lt;time.h\u0026amp;gt; #include \u0026amp;lt;stdio.h\u0026amp;gt; void main() { struct timeval tvTime; struct tm tmOutput; gettimeofday(\u0026amp;amp;tvTime, 0); localtime_r(\u0026amp;amp;(tvTime.tv_sec), \u0026amp;amp;tmOutput); tmOutput.tm_mon += 1; printf(\u0026#34;password for today is: %x%02d-%02x%02d\\n\\n\u0026#34;, tmOutput.tm_mon, tmOutput.tm_mon, tmOutput.tm_mday, gcd(tmOutput.tm_mon, tmOutput.tm_mday)); } int gcd(int a, int b) { return (b?gcd(b,a%b):a); } Compile and run the code above with gcc. You can also use the excellent Codepad Repl.it to run the code online and get the password for today (no registration needed).\nBonus tip: if you\u0026rsquo;re curious how exactly the password is generated, here\u0026rsquo;s the algorithm:\n1st character = month in hexadecimal, lower case (1=Jan, \u0026hellip; , a=Oct, b=Nov, c=Dec) 2-3 = month in decimal, zero padded and starting in 1 (01, 02, 03, \u0026hellip;, 11, 12) 4 = dash 5-6 = day of the month in hex (01, 02 .., 0A, .., 1F) 7-8 = greatest common divisor between month and day, zero padded. This is always a number between 01 and 12. So, let\u0026rsquo;s say today is October 15, the password would be: a10-0f05 where a = month in hex, 10 = month in decimal, 0f = day in hex, 05 = greatest divisor between 10 and 15).\nIf you have trouble calculating the greatest common divisor (elementary math, anyone?), Wolfram Alpha is your friend.\nThis was tested on a Synology DS212+, with Marvell Kirkwood mv6282 chipset. It\u0026rsquo;s unlikely but still possible that different models use a different algorithm. YMMV, so always check the source code.\n[UPDATE 1: Several users reported that this works in many other models, including DS409, DS112j, etc. Please leave a comment with your model and firmware version.]\n[UPDATE 2: If it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work, it\u0026rsquo;s probably that your date is incorrect in the NAS. Per Patrick\u0026rsquo;s suggestion in the comments below, try \u0026ldquo;101-0101\u0026rdquo;, which is the password for Jan 01]\n","permalink":"https://wrgms.com/synologys-secret-telnet-password/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIf you have a Synology NAS and had some sort of disk crash in the past, you\u0026rsquo;ve probably encountered the famous \u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;Cannot format system partition\u0026rdquo;\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;Please configure your router to forward port 23 to DiskStation and contact Synology online support\u0026rdquo;\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, it sucks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt sucks even more when you know the disk is perfectly fine, and you still have hopes to recover your data.

The software is robust and much better than my old DroboFS, and the fact that it is entirely open source is a big plus.\nI recently upgraded the firmware to DSM 2661. Everything worked fine. For 12 hours. The next morning, the device was dead, with the blue blink of death).\nWas it the new firmware? Or maybe a disk crash? Who knows.\nI followed the basic tests recommended by Synology: remove both disks, turn it on and wait 30s for a long beep. Beeeeeep. Great, the motherboard is still functional. It also responded to ping and showed up on DS Assistant, so processor and ethernet are also working fine.\nThe Synology DS NAS is basically an embedded Linux box, using md + lvm for RAID. Nothing is proprietary, so I mounted the disks on my Linux desktop and spent a few more hours cloning and re-building the RAID using a spare disk. Life is good.\nTill\u0026hellip; it crashed again.\nThere was something wrong with the system partition, so I wanted to see inside the NAS, before the kernel finishes booting.\nThankfully, Synology folks already put a physical serial port in there. It\u0026rsquo;s not documented, but it\u0026rsquo;s not hard to find. You just have to open the case.\nDisclaimer: make sure you have backup! I am not responsible if you lose your data, void your warranty, burn down your house or kill your dog.\nStart by opening the case. Here\u0026rsquo;s a video with instructions [update: the original video is not available anymore, but here\u0026rsquo;s a similar one]. Be aware this may break the small internal hooks, and you\u0026rsquo;ll need to use tape or hot glue to put it back together (what\u0026rsquo;s wrong with manufacturers these days? What\u0026rsquo;s the problem with good old screws?) Inside the case, look for a 6-pin header, normally labeled JP2 (or COM1 on older models). The pins likely are: Pin Number Function Confirmed on Synology DS212+ \u0026nbsp; 13.3V 2GND 4TX 6RX Now connect the pins 2, 4 and 6 (respectively GNS, TX, RX) to your USB-TTL 3v3 cable (if using the FTDI cable from Adafruit, it\u0026rsquo;ll be 1-black, 5-yellow, 4-orange. Make sure you don\u0026rsquo;t short-circuit any of the pins. These male-female jumper wires could be useful. Open your preferred terminal program (under Win ExtraPutty is the best in town), set to 115200, disable xon/xoff, and you\u0026rsquo;re all set. Now you can turn on your DS, and see all the beauty of what\u0026rsquo;s going on under the hood:\n__ __ _ _ | \\/ | __ _ _ ____ _____| | | | |\\/| |/ _` | \u0026#39;__\\ \\ / / _ \\ | | | | | | (_| | | \\ V / __/ | | |_| |_|\\__,_|_| \\_/ \\___|_|_| _ _ ____ _ | | | | | __ ) ___ ___ | |_ | | | |___| _ \\ / _ \\ / _ \\| __| | |_| |___| |_) | (_) | (_) | |_ \\___/ |____/ \\___/ \\___/ \\__| ** LOADER ** ** MARVELL BOARD: Synology Disk Station LE U-Boot 1.1.4 (Dec 2 2011 - 15:56:02) Marvell version: 3.5.9 U-Boot code: 00600000 -\u0026amp;gt; 0067FFF0 BSS: -\u0026amp;gt; 0068B3D4 Soc: 88F6282 A1CPU running @ 2000Mhz L2 running @ 500Mhz SysClock = 500Mhz , TClock = 200Mhz DRAM (DDR3) CAS Latency = 7 tRP = 7 tRAS = 20 tRCD=7 DRAM CS[0] base 0x00000000 size 256MB DRAM CS[1] base 0x10000000 size 256MB DRAM Total size 512MB 16bit width Addresses 8M - 0M are saved for the U-Boot usage.

It\u0026rsquo;s sad to see so much work and love going nowhere. At least they were classy and wrote a candid and honest shutting-down post, and they\u0026rsquo;re even refunding users (!). That\u0026rsquo;s a level of integrity that you don\u0026rsquo;t see everyday in the startup world.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;ve never played Glitch, it\u0026rsquo;s now too late. The game world is now restricted to existing users, and everything will shut down on December 9th 2012. Here\u0026rsquo;s some videos to give you an idea of what you missed.\nI was part of the first wave of beta testers. Even though I\u0026rsquo;ve never spent much time playing, I remember how every detail was carefullyt thought through, and painstakenly executed. The videos don\u0026rsquo;t do justice to their attention to detail.\nBut, aside from the intrinsic beauty, the gameplay was dull. It was just a cute massive multiplayer social game. Maybe the cutest ever. But without a strong storytelling or any of the gamification tactics from other social gaming companies, there was no reason for you to keep coming back.\nIn a world of \u0026ldquo;Your crops are dying! Your friend Samantha just moved to a farm next door. Invite your friends to level up faster.\u0026rdquo;, it\u0026rsquo;s hard to keep users engaged these days.\nThis reminds me of the Steve Blank\u0026rsquo;s MVP stories. Do you need to develop a full game, with so many levels, intricate dialogues, dozens of non-playable characters, only to realize that your users aren\u0026rsquo;t coming back in the first place?\nCan\u0026rsquo;t you create a demo with a couple of levels and a handful of hard-coded NPCs, and invite your mom/sister/significant other to play? Just check how many times they come back (when you\u0026rsquo;re not looking). You\u0026rsquo;ll achieve the same conclusions, with 10% of the effort.\nOf course hindsight is a bitch \u0026ndash; or, like someone said on HN: \u0026quot;\u0026hellip;hindsight is a Glitch\u0026quot; :). Sometimes you can\u0026rsquo;t just hack an MVP together; you need a fully polished product. But I don\u0026rsquo;t think that\u0026rsquo;s the case here.\nIt seems to me they put too much effort on having a full product, and lost sight of the bigger picture. They repeated some of the same fatal mistakes others have done. For example, Lessons from Habitat outlines many of the same pitfalls, as seen by the creators of Lucasfilm in the mid-80\u0026rsquo;s. The entire paper is a great read, but one part that strikes me as relevant to this discussion:\n\u0026ldquo;While we find much of the work presently being done on elaborate interface technologies \u0026ndash; DataGloves, head-mounted displays, special-purpose rendering engines, and so on \u0026ndash; both exciting and promising, the almost mystical euphoria that currently seems to surround all this hardware is, in our opinion, both excessive and somewhat misplaced.\nWe can\u0026rsquo;t help having a nagging sense that it\u0026rsquo;s all a bit of a distraction from the really pressing issues.\n*At the core of our vision is the idea that cyberspace is necessarily a multiple-participant environment. It seems to us that the things that are important to the inhabitants of such an environment are the capabilities available to them, the characteristics of the other people they encounter there, and the ways these various participants can affect one another.\nBeyond a foundation set of communications capabilities, the details of the technology used to present this environment to its participants, while sexy and interesting, are of relatively peripheral concern.\u0026rdquo;\nKeep in mind the first Habitat was launched in 1986, almost 30 years ago, and ran in 64Kb on a Commodore64.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re now spoiled by Call Of Duty and hyper-realist NBA games. But there\u0026rsquo;s a point to be made that the success of an MMO game is not defined by its level of peripheral sophistication (be it design, cuteness, or head-mounted displays), but by the social experience, and how people interact with each other. Minecraft, with its blocky graphics and limited interactivity, is a prime example.\nGlitch isn\u0026rsquo;t alone in repeating these mistakes. Worlds Chat did the same two decades ago, being the first 3D world ever created. It was later replaced by The Palace. Later Philip Rosedale had his chance with Second Life, which exploded, then burst, and now is becoming cool again (and Philip is trying his hand again with High Fidelity).\nAnother issue with Glitch was its channel distribution. It\u0026rsquo;s challenging in 2012 to succeed with a web-only game, especially if you\u0026rsquo;re not anchored on Facebook. And Glitch was built in Flash (!), so it missed billions of 2-3 minutes slots of free time that people have when waiting for the train, bathroom, elevator.

Sony. HBGary Hack. FBI. Paypal, Visa \u0026amp; MasterCard. Mubarak. Occupy Wall Street. SOPA/PIPA.\nAnonymous has been busy for the past few years. It started as juvenile pranks on 4chan\u0026rsquo;s boards, but grew and became a powerful mechanism against oppressive governments and unscrupulous corporations.\nIts trajectory was beautifully captured in the documentary \u0026ldquo;We Are Legion: The Story of the Hacktivists\u0026rdquo;, that will be released later this year. I had the pleasure to watch the premiere in Austin during SXSW, and I must say - it\u0026rsquo;s f..ing brilliant. The movie is still in post-production, so the theatrical release may be slightly different.\nWe also participated in an exclusive interview with the film director \u0026ldquo;Brian Knappenberger\u0026rdquo;, who was joined on stage by former Anonymous member Gregg Housh and two special guests Anon behind masks: one from Austin, and another just called Anonymous9000, connecting via Skype from an undisclosed location (and using a robotic voice changer). It was a surreal experience.\nTogether they gave a passionate and fascinating perspective of the evolution of Anonymous, its internal workings, and the journey since 4Chan to the present day. They discussed how the group went after the Church of Scientology, why they hacked HBGary, discussed the release of confidential data of Sony customers, and how lately they\u0026rsquo;ve started to engage in social movements around freedom, Occupy Wall Street, the Arab Spring, and the support to Wikileaks\u0026rsquo; founder, Julian Assange.\nA few highlights of the session, in no particular order:\nsome Anons don\u0026rsquo;t agree with the dump of personal information (like in Sony\u0026rsquo;s case). But a few radical sub-groups - like Lulzsec - have a different opinion, and believe the press only pays attention when something concrete happens. Ironically, one of the most vocal supporters of dumping personal data was Sabu - which was revealed last week to be an FBI informant since June 2011. Conflict of interest, maybe?\nAnons in general don\u0026rsquo;t support attacking the press, as they believe in freedom of expression themselves (even when it is press against Anonymous). Some may disagree. Others simply don\u0026rsquo;t care; they\u0026rsquo;re in for the lulz, and accuse others of being moralfags. It\u0026rsquo;s these constant disagreements within Anonymous\u0026rsquo; anarchic structure that gave birth to dissidents, like Lulzsec.\n\u0026ldquo;Thousands of twenty-something socially awkward nerds got laid for the first time due to these movements and events in real life. Behind a mask, they all felt more comfortable in expressing themselves and talking with girls. We saw several marriages between Anons that met while protesting against the Church of Scientology and others\u0026rdquo;.\n\u0026ldquo;The DDoS attacks have just one objective: attract press. Whenever we have a message that we want the press to distribute, we DDoS someone so the press will publish the news that Anonymous attacked again, followed by what we wanted them to communicate. Otherwise we\u0026rsquo;d be just ignored. Look at SOPA/PIPA; we\u0026rsquo;ve been talking about this for years, and no one ever cared. Then we DDoS\u0026rsquo;d RIAA/MPAA/DoJ websites\u0026hellip; and the press showed up in full force overnight.\u0026rdquo;\nWatch the trailer here [YouTube].\nUpdate 2012-11-17: now also available for rental on Vimeo. This is the first time that Vimeo does movie rental. EDIT: Vimeo link is broken, but as of May 2025 it is now available on YouTube.\nUpdate 2012-10-17: it is opening in theatres this weekend. NY, LA, Houston, Canada, Rio de Janeiro and others. Check to see if your city is in the list. You can also pre-order the movie, starting on 10/30.

If you\u0026rsquo;re not one of the 12,000 people already using the service (that\u0026rsquo;s the number Andrea gave during the talk), well\u0026hellip; you should give it a try, because everyone is talking about it. Yeah, I live in the echo chamber, I know.\nGlancee, like its competitors Highlight, Sonar, Banjo, are all exploring the new niche of location social discovery - some sort of Match.com-meets-LinkedIn. Unproven territory, but sounds promising (albeit somewhat dystopian) to me. Andrea spoke about the current status of social discovery apps and the different approaches taken by each player. He also mentioned the incredible growth (hard to see 12,000 as incredible, but startup founders have to drink their own Kool-Aid), particularly with all the buzz around SXSW.\nBut to me the most interesting tidbit was the concept of monetizing the service via Spatial Analysis.\nHe didn\u0026rsquo;t elaborate much, so let me speculate a bit here. Consider that you have a device on your pocket that is connected to Facebook (i.e. knows everything about your attitudinal behavior - including Likes, affinity with brands, reach, friends). You have Glancee installed, and as such it is constantly broadcasting your current geolocation. Every. Single. Minute. Like Google Latitude, but with a Facebook social layer on top of it.\nNot only it knows who you are and what you like, but also where you\u0026rsquo;ve been, where you work, live, play, study, shop, your the preferred gas station, and countries you\u0026rsquo;ve travelled.\nAll this leads to a level of geospatial analysis never seen before, using all your social graph as an extra dimension. You could plot heatmaps showing location of people that liked your brand on FB, and use to optimize out-of-home media placement. Or monitor the consumers of a competitor brand when planning new physical stores. Basically it\u0026rsquo;s any marketer\u0026rsquo;s dream come true.\nOf course, it has just one small problem: it needs permission, and critical mass. You need tens of millions of users using the service, in order to have a meaningful representation.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why Andreas was so adamant when I asked him about his number one goal: \u0026ldquo;Growth. And fast\u0026rdquo;.\nUpdate 2012-05-04: it seems Facebook may agree with me here \u0026ndash; Facebook just announced they\u0026rsquo;re acquiring Glancee. I guess Andrea can scratch off \u0026ldquo;Growth\u0026rdquo; from his list.\n","permalink":"https://wrgms.com/glancee/","summary":"\u003ccenter\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Glancee at SXSW\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/content/images/2014/Feb/glancee.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/center\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy last session of SXSW Day 2 was with \u003ca href=\"http://andreavaccari.com/\"\u003eAndrea Vaccari\u003c/a\u003e, the CEO of the trendy location-based discovery startup \u003ca href=\"http://www.glancee.com/\"\u003eGlancee\u003c/a\u003e.

But despite recent progress with Content Network and YouTube, the marketing community still see the search giant as a way to drive conversion at the bottom of the funnel. In order to move to the next level, Google has to prove they can create emotional connections with consumers.\nEnter Project Re:Brief, just announced during SXSW.\nAccording to Aman Govil, Google\u0026rsquo;s Product Marketing Manager, the idea was to \u0026ldquo;re-imagine iconic campaigns of 4 classic global brands through the lenses of modern technology\u0026rdquo;. The project aims to be a benchmark of what is possible when you have the right idea and the perfect balance between creativity \u0026amp; technology.\nThe brands were carefully selected: Coca-Cola with Hilltop, Volvo with Drive it like you hate it, Avis We try harder, and Alka-Seltzer I can\u0026rsquo;t believe I ate the whole thing. The secret sauce was that they brought back from retirement the original creators of these 4 campaigns, and paired them with digital creatives, so they could re-imagine their original creations, leveraging today\u0026rsquo;s technology.\nIt was fascinating to see people like Harvey Gabor (Coca-Cola\u0026rsquo;s Hilltop, 1971) working with a bunch of twenty-something, and discovering how to use touch screens, mobile, realtime web.\nI had the opportunity to chat with Aman and Drew (the global creative director for the new campaigns) to understand how they pulled it together. Surprisingly, each project took just 2-3 months, and were executed with a relatively small budget (\u0026ldquo;Less than a TV spots\u0026rdquo;, told me Drew). Seems the advertisers were initially resistant to touch iconic pieces like Hilltop, but eventually understood the spirit of the project, and loved the opportunity to work with the original creators.\nWhat is even more fascinating is that not a single can of Coke or Alka-Seltzer was sold because this initiative. Google pulled this off not to help their clients sell more, but to help themseves. The target audience was marketers and agencies, hoping they would talk, comment, write blog posts. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t get more meta than this.\nCheck out more at www.projectrebrief.com, and look for the documentary later this year.\nUpdate 2012-06-22: the full documentary is now available on YouTube.\n","permalink":"https://wrgms.com/rebrief/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/content/images/2014/Feb/google_rebrief-1.png\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the past years Google has been trying to go beyond search, diversifying their revenue sources.

It took me some time to make it work like I wanted (keyboard, extensions, application menu, etc), but I\u0026rsquo;m quite happy with everything. Or almost everything.\nOne thing I enjoyed over the years was the ability to customize my keyboard shortcuts. I have dozens of shotcuts - to center windows on my screen, to open programs, start and stop Spotify, to run macros, to log in to my remote servers, and so on.\nOne of my handy shortcuts is \u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;F1\u0026gt; to open an xterm with superuser, and \u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;F2\u0026gt; for regular user. I use custom xterm profiles, so I can easily check if I\u0026rsquo;m running under a privileged context by looking at the color of the window.\nThis worked well for years under Ubuntu 14.04 and Gnome 3.20, but stopped working with the upgrade to Bionic Beaver. More specifically, \u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;F1\u0026gt; is now System Help, with no way to change it.\n\u0026ldquo;No problem\u0026rdquo;, I thought; this can be easily adjusted in System Settings.\nNops.\nI searched around, and found other folks with the same problem, but no solution.\nI then decided to dug into the source code, and discovered the improbable: Gnome devs decided the help was so important that it deserved its own unique, hardcoded, and immutable shortcut. If you want to reassign it, you\u0026rsquo;re out of luck.\nAccording to gnome-settings-daemon changelog:\n=============== Version 3.21.90 =============== ... Media keys: - Add Super+F1 as a hardcoded shortcut for launching Help ... REALLY? What\u0026rsquo;s wrong with a default icon in the toolbar, or maybe a popup window when you boot for the first time? Also, does anyone really care about reading the basic documentation for\u0026hellip; a windows manager?\nI wasn\u0026rsquo;t convinced yet, but a closer look at the source code confirmed my fear: there it was: (file /gnome-settings-daemon/blob/master/plugins/media-keys/shortcuts-list.h):\n{ HELP_KEY, NULL, N_(\u0026#34;Help\u0026#34;), \u0026#34;\u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;F1\u0026#34;, GSD_ACTION_MODE_LAUNCHER }, So if you\u0026rsquo;re really determined to regain control of your \u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;F1\u0026gt;, there\u0026rsquo;s only one solution: to recompile gnome-settings-daemon, and replace the gsd-media-keys plugin. Spoiler alert: I\u0026rsquo;m glad to report that my patch was successful, but beware: getting the right dependencies and recompiling Gnome is not an easy feat. Keep reading if you\u0026rsquo;re interested in doing the same:\nDownload and install Gnome Builder Click on \u0026ldquo;Clone\u0026rdquo;, select a local directory (e.g., ~/Projects/) and use the official repo at https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-settings-daemon Open xterm, and enter cd ~/Projects/gnome-settings-daemon; git checkout tags/GNOME_SETTINGS_DAEMON_3_28_1 (you can check your exact version with gnome-shell --version. Check all tags available with git tag -l) Install all dependencies. These were the ones missing in my system, but YMMV: apt install libcolord-dev \\ libgeocode-glib-dev \\ gnome-desktop3-data \\ libgnome-desktop-3-dev \\ libgweather-3-dev \\ libcanberra-gtk3-dev \\ libgeoclue-2-dev \\ libnotify-dev \\ libpulse-mainloop-glib0 \\ libpulse-dev \\ gobject-introspection \\ libupower-glib-dev \\ libpolkit-gobject-1-dev \\ libasound2-dev \\ libgudev-1.0-dev \\ libwacom-dev \\ libnss3-dev \\ libcups2-dev \\ libnm-dev Patch the source code by editing ~/Projects/gnome-settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/shortcuts-list.h, and add a comment in front of the offender, like below (for Gnome 3.28.1 it is in line 69): // disabled! // { HELP_KEY, NULL, N_(\u0026#34;Help\u0026#34;), \u0026#34;\u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;F1\u0026#34;, GSD_ACTION_MODE_LAUNCHER }, Click [Rebuild] button in the Builder UI to compile (note: you need to click Rebuild, and not Build). You may want to turn off the deprecation warnings by editing meson.build and adding '-Wno-deprecated-declarations' to test_cflags = [...]; (line 70). If you installed all the dependencies correctly, you should have no warnings nor errors. Find the compiled binaries. You\u0026rsquo;re looking specifically for the plugin gsd-media-keys, so it\u0026rsquo;ll likely be in the directory ~/.var/app/org.gnome.Builder/cache/gnome-builder/projects/gnome-settings-daemon/builds/default-host-HEAD/plugins/media-keys cd ~/.var/app/org.gnome.Builder/cache/gnome-builder/projects/gnome-settings-daemon/builds/default-host-HEAD/plugins/media-keys ~ cp ./gsd-media-keys ~/gsd-media-keys.patched Before proceeding, you may want to inspect your binary to confirm it successfully linked with shared libraries by using ldd ~/gsd-media-keys.patched. In my case I had problems finding libgsd.so, so I solved it by adding the path to ldconfig (although the correct solution would be to fix this in the build system): sudo sh -c \u0026#39;echo \u0026#34;# gnome-settings-daemon\\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gnome-settings-daemon-3.0/\\n\u0026#34; \u0026gt; /etc/ld.so.conf.d/gnome-settings-daemon.conf\u0026#39; sudo ldconfig You\u0026rsquo;re now ready to install the patched gsd-media-keys binary in your system: cd /usr/lib/gnome-settings-daemon/ sudo mv ~/gsd-media-keys.patched . sudo strip -s ./gsd-media-keys.patched sudo mv gsd-media-keys gsd-media-keys.orig sudo ln -s gsd-media-keys.patched gsd-media-keys Log out or reboot, and you\u0026rsquo;re done! If all goes well, your system now should be running the gsd-media-keys plugin without the \u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;F1\u0026gt; hardcoded, so you can reassign to anything you like.\nIf anything goes wrong and you can\u0026rsquo;t log in, don\u0026rsquo;t despair. Simply open a console terminal by using \u0026lt;Ctrl\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;Alt\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;F2\u0026gt; and restore your original gsd-media-keys binary by doing:\ncd /usr/lib/gnome-settings-daemon/ sudo rm gsd-media-keys sudo ln -s gsd-media-keys.orig gsd-media-keys Use \u0026lt;Ctrl\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;Alt\u0026gt;\u0026lt;F1\u0026gt; to go back to Gnome and log in again. You can then inspect /var/log/syslog to understand what went wrong (search for \u0026ldquo;media-keys\u0026rdquo;). It\u0026rsquo;s likely that you had problems with the dynamic libraries in step 8 above.\n","permalink":"https://wrgms.com/fixing-gnome-3-2x-hardcoded-superf1-shortcut/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eUbuntu 18.04 LTS is finally out, and with it you now have Gnome out of the box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve been using Gnome for several years, and have enjoyed its minimalism.

You may smile. But it will come…” [Henry Ford, 1940]\nFlying cars are not something new. The idea has been going around since the 19th century, even before the very first flight by Santos-Dumont (or Wright Brothers, depending on your bias). But it was The Jetsons who first brought the concept of flying cars to the masses. We grew up dreaming that one day we\u0026rsquo;d be able to get in our cars and fly straight to our destination - fast, safely, and traffic-free.\nThanks to Moore\u0026rsquo;s Law and the latest advances in engineering, we may be closer to flying cars than you think.\nAeroMobil is an innovative company from Slovakia, founded by Štefan Klein and Juraj Vaculik. Štefan, a well-known designer for Audi, Volkswagen and BMW, has been pursuing this idea for more than two decades. Juraj has a long and successful track record in advertising and as an investor. The two minds came together to create the company and make the dream a reality.\nDuring his talk at SXSW today, Juraj talked about the latest advances and their recent flying prototypes. As you can see on the two videos below, they made quite a progress between version 2.5 (early 2013) and 3.0 (late 2014).\nAeroMobil 2.5:\nAeroMobil 3.0: (note that Štefan himself test drives every prototype. He believes no one understand the machines better than him)\nDespite the progress, don\u0026rsquo;t expect to be driving - err.. flying - just yet. There are still several roadblocks (no pun intended) before mass adoption. They still need to figure out logistical challenges, like fueling stations, or grass strips next to roads for landing and take off. And change legislations, and define new testing procedures and certification. Or get people certified as pilots (yeah, don\u0026rsquo;t think your driver\u0026rsquo;s license will fly).\nBut with Google investing so heavily in self-driving cars, and SpaceX sending rockets to space, it\u0026rsquo;s not hard to imagine these efforts converging and eventually giving birth to self-driving flying cars. It might sound crazy at first, but there\u0026rsquo;s a good chance we\u0026rsquo;ll see it in our lifetime. AeroMobil may be in the exact spot that Paul Graham calls a Frighteningly Ambitious Startup Idea.\nCrazy? Yes.

With 800+ sessions this year, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to get overwhelmed. But get over your FOMO, and enjoy the serendipity. You will miss many good sessions, and that\u0026rsquo;s OK. The best talk will be that one you didn\u0026rsquo;t plan, and just entered because your first option was full.\nSpeaking of crowded sessions: always have a plan B. Your first option will likely be full, so having a second/third option is always important.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t go to panels. Ever. There\u0026rsquo;s hardly enough time for one person to convey a good idea in under 60 minutes. 4 or 5 becomes a festival of shallow sound bites. You already have Twitter for those.\nSeek geeky and obscure talks. The less buzzwords on the description, the better. Extra points if the talk is by someone who is actually making things - rather than people talking about those who made it. I saw some unbelievably good sessions in the past which had less 20 participants in the audience.\nBring an extra battery pack. Your phone will die midday, even if you have an iPhone 6 Plus. Pack some extra juice.\nPlan your commute time between sessions. Some venues are 2 miles away from Austin Convention Center, and shuttles may take 15-30 min door-to-door. Try Lyft/Uber, or pedicabs. Or you can be ultra-hipster and apply for a loaner Boosted Board. I already secured mine!\nDriving is usually a bad idea. Parking is expensive, and you may want to have a beer or two (or six or ten). Get an Uber/Lyft, or use the official shuttles, but be prepared to spend one hour each way. And remind yourself next time to book your ticket the exact minute they go on sale, and enjoy the convenience of a hotel in walking distance.\nHave a good breakfast. You won\u0026rsquo;t eat much during the day, and you\u0026rsquo;re probably still recovering from last night.\nRSVPs are usually useless. Most of the parties don\u0026rsquo;t require RSVP, and use it just to collect email addresses. And the ones that do are not the ones you see on blogs. [EDIT: this used to be true, but it\u0026rsquo;s now starting to change. Many parties are now respecting RSVPs, and even many of the talks in the official program started to require reservation, so play safe and do your homework.]\nRemember: SXSW is a marathon, not a sprint. It\u0026rsquo;s 5 full days (double if you do Music/Film), so take time to enjoy yourself. It\u0026rsquo;s Spring, and there\u0026rsquo;s no better time to be in Austin.

The requirements are:\nMust be able to listen continuously Run on embedded ARM processors (particuarly Raspberry Pi and BeagleBone Black) Good accuracy on a limited set of words (English only) Decent performance, particularly on low-power CPUs My first thought was to use Google Speech API. The accuracy is great, and it\u0026rsquo;s reasonably fast. But it is also limited to only 50 calls per day, so it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t satisfy requirement #1. And I don\u0026rsquo;t like the idea of streaming all of my personal conversations to anyone. It\u0026rsquo;s already enough to have NSA listening to my phone calls\u0026hellip;\n(maybe it\u0026rsquo;s an option for the future, when implementing something with a physical push-button, like a Star Trek communicator device)\nSiriProxy is another neat hack, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work with iOS7/8 anymore. Apple will soon offer an official interface to Siri via its HomeKit program, but it\u0026rsquo;ll only work with licensed hardware. Likely not an option for hackers and personal projects.\nAfter some research, I found CMUSphinx project, which seems to be the best project in the area of voice recognition. PocketSphinx toolkit is the version you want for embedded CPUs, as it\u0026rsquo;s pure C, and rather portable.\nThe documentation is not very friendly, but once you get it going, it works well.\nThe first step is to download and install SphinxBase, followed by PocketSphinx. The README has instructions to compile and install, but it\u0026rsquo;s the basic\n./configure make make install By default it\u0026rsquo;ll install binaries to /usr/local/bin, and language models to /usr/local/share. Make sure you have swig and alsa drivers installed before starting (apt-get install swig alsa-base alsa-utils).\nOnce installed, you need to figure out which dictionary model you want to use. Just for testing, I created a dictionary with 106 words, based on the old Logo language (remember the Logo turtle?), like forward, backward, turn right, turn left, etc.\nBefore you can start training PocketSphinx, you\u0026rsquo;ll need an acoustic model. Sadly, the speech corpus (i.e., audio files with spoken words) used to train the models are usually closed source. So either you spend a couple of hours recording the voices (or using an4/Voxforge) to train your own model, or you\u0026rsquo;ll skip this entirely and just use some of the built-in models, accepting lower accuracy. Given my limited number of words in the dictionary, I decided to go with built in acoustic models.\nNext, you need to describe your Language Model - the words, grammar, and frequency of words that you want to recognize. This tutorial has more details. If you\u0026rsquo;re in a hurry and just want to get PocketSphinx going with a dictionary for your pre-defined words, save yourself some trouble and use the online lmtool. This webservice will allow you to upload your dictionary file (a simple ASCII file, with one sentence or word per line), and it\u0026rsquo;ll generate all the language models you need to run PocketSphinx.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a sample of my dictionary file:\nannounce answer ask back clipboard color copy count ... sentence set space square root stamp wait wait until when who word If you want to play with this dictionary, download these files here, and run:\npocketsphinx_continuous -lm lm/logo.lm -dict lm/logo.dic (note: if pocketsphinx is stuck at READY, it\u0026rsquo;s probably listening to the wrong hw device. Check where is the microphone attached via cat /proc/asound/cards, and add -adcdev plughw:X,0 to the line above, replacing X by the hardware id of your microphone).\npocketsphinx_continuous -lm lm/logo.lm -dict lm/logo.dic -adcdev plughw:2,0 Smartphones use all sorts of tricks to cancel the background noise, but that requires special hardware, so you\u0026rsquo;ll need a reasonable quiet environment. Otherwise the accuracy will suffer, depending on how large your dictionary is.\nAs you would expect, smaller dictionaries have much better accuracy. With a 100-word, I got 60-70% correct. After I reduced to a simple 15-words dictionary, I got virtually 100% match rate, even with some background noise and a non-American accent. Certainly enough for my projects.\nNext up: running this on a Raspberry Pi, installing a decent openair microphone, and testing overall performance when connected to a home automation system.

It\u0026rsquo;s a shame that Linux keyboard is still horribly broken by default (some may say it\u0026rsquo;s by design; no, it\u0026rsquo;s not).\nIt has been asked before, but most answers will point you to use xim, which will open another can of worms.

Some say it\u0026rsquo;ll the the digital renaissance; others claim it\u0026rsquo;s the best thing to ever happen to the web, after the browser itself.\nThis video summarizes well the sentiment:\nThis is wrong.\nTen years from now we\u0026rsquo;ll look back and realize how much the new gTLDs have hurt us.\nFirst, most of the new gTLDs add little or no value. I bet we could live another 50 years without a .ninja, a .soy, .fail, .florist, or .loans.\nOthers will proclaim that the new gTLDs are useful, and point to domains like .nyc, .london, or .website, as examples of the \u0026ldquo;democratization\u0026rdquo; promoted by the new categories.\nBut these will be the exception rather than the rule. In practice the new gTLDS will force brands to spend millions of dollars to protect against cybersquatters rushing to claim new brand-related domains, amongst other threats.\nBefore you had to register your brand across a handful of TLDs. Now you have 1,400 more to worry about. That\u0026rsquo;s like a whack-a-mole game, but you\u0026rsquo;re outnumbered by hundreds of moles for each hand you have.\nAnd yet, this is not my main concern. Brands got screwed and will spend a ton of money, while domain registrars will be laughing all the way to the bank. Whatever, life will be fine.\nMy concern is a different one: the new gTLDs will accelerate the demise of the URI.\nWe already lost users to search. It\u0026rsquo;s more convenient to type \u0026ldquo;Brand\u0026rdquo; on the browser and let your search engine do the rest than typing \u0026ldquo;brand.com\u0026rdquo;. And on mobile the URL is already hidden from the user, as if it were an irrelevant technical implementation detail. Same on Safari on desktop.\nBut now multiply this situation by thousands of gTLDs, and you\u0026rsquo;ll have the perfect Paradox of Choice. Is it a .com, a .net, .cc? Nops. Keep going friend.\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s add to the mix the fact that a) most of the mobile traffic is already coming from native apps, and b) Apple is pushing to bury the URI, and c) Google is replacing everything by its omni-search. And we\u0026rsquo;re not even talking about Siri or voice-activated search. This will result in a very different world. My prediction: thanks to the new gTLDs, mobile apps and commercial players will have even more control than today, and URLs will be demoted to second-class citizens. They will still be there, but buried somewhere in the sub-menus of your browser, or the API of your Chrome extensions. Just like IP addresses; you know it\u0026rsquo;s there somewhere, but nobody cares.\nIn the name of find-ability and ease of use, we\u0026rsquo;ll live in an URL-less world. And commercial entities will be rewarded and profit from your traffic.\nI\u0026rsquo;m sure that\u0026rsquo;s not the web that Sir Tim Berners-Lee envisioned 25 years ago.\n","permalink":"https://wrgms.com/gtlds-and-the-death-of-urls/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eUnless you\u0026rsquo;ve been living under a rock, you\u0026rsquo;ve read \u003cem\u003ead nauseum\u003c/em\u003e about the overly optimistic predictions for the new gTLDs.

Wrong.\nBut this time I was the one to blame.\nAfter solving the conflict with bash, I changed /etc/passwd user shell to /bin/bash. The only problem is that Synology wipes the system partition during firmware upgrades, so when I upgraded to DSM 4.1.2668, my custom `/bin/bash``was gone. Of course this locked me out of the system. No SSH, SCP or FTP. Great.\nAfter a few moments of panic, I remembered I still had the serial console. So I could put Linux in single user mode, and drop into recovery mode.\nSo if you\u0026rsquo;re ever in a similar situation, here\u0026rsquo;s how to fix it:\n1. First, you need a serial console.\n2. During U-Boot, press any key to cancel the automatic kernel boot (Hit any key to stop autoboot).\n3. Enter printenv to check the environment variables. Search for bootargs and bootm variables (they will be different on your system, so do NOT copy and paste from mine, unless you have a Synology DS212+ with the same DSM).\n4. Append reboot=cold,hard emergency init=/bin/sh to the end of bootargs variable. In my case, this is what I used:\nsetenv bootargs \u0026#39;console=ttyS0,115200 ip=off initrd=0x00800040,4M root=/dev/md0 rw syno_hw_version=DS212pv20 ihd_num=2 netif_num=1 esata_7042=1 reboot=cold,hard emergency init=/bin/sh\u0026#39; (again, your parameters will likely be different, so don\u0026rsquo;t copy and paste)\n5. Boot your kernel, with\nbootm F8080000 F8280000 Now your Synology should be happily botting in single user mode, ignoring /etc/passwd and dropping you to a plain shell. Do what you have to do to fix the system, and reboot.\nYou can also use these steps to recover your system partition from a crash or other problem.\n","permalink":"https://wrgms.com/entering-single-user-mode-on-a-synology/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/content/images/2019/06/upowerd.png\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hope this will be my last post about Synology for a while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter dealing for a few weeks with an \u003ca href=\"http://forum.synology.com/enu/viewtopic.php?f=221\u0026amp;t=59808\u0026amp;start=45#p232455\"\u003eunstable environment\u003c/a\u003e, then \u003ca href=\"/recovering-a-failed-synology-diskstation-ds2xx-serial\"\u003ehacking a serial console\u003c/a\u003e to troubleshoot, then \u003ca href=\"/synologys-secret-telnet-password/\"\u003ecracking the secret recovery telnet password\u003c/a\u003e just for fun, and finally solving the \u003ca href=\"http://serverfault.com/questions/458553/cant-log-in-via-ssh-to-any-accounts-set-to-use-bin-bash-as-a-default-shell/\"\u003eweird mistery\u003c/a\u003e of SSH \u003ca href=\"/reverse-engineering-synology-openssh\"\u003enot accepting /bin/bash as default shell\u003c/a\u003e, I thought I finally had a stable environment.

The user has to be called \u0026ldquo;root\u0026rdquo;.\nWHAAAT?\nThankfully, Synology uses a modified Linux distribution, so they publish the code under GPL.\nAfter a couple of hours looking at the OpenSSH source code, things became pretty obvious. Here\u0026rsquo;s the piece of code from their version of OpenSSH 5.8p1, file session.c:\nvoid do_child(Session *s, const char *command) { ... #ifdef MY_ABC_HERE char szValue[8]; int RunSSH = 0; SSH_CMD SSHCmd = REQ_UNKNOWN; if (1 == GetKeyValue(\u0026#34;/etc/synoinfo.conf\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;runssh\u0026#34;, szValue, sizeof(szValue))) { if (strcasecmp(szValue, \u0026#34;yes\u0026#34;) == 0) { RunSSH = 1; } } if (IsSFTPReq(command)){ SSHCmd = REQ_SFTP; } else if (IsRsyncReq(command)){ SSHCmd = REQ_RSYNC; } else if (IsTimebkpRequest(command)){ SSHCmd = REQ_TIMEBKP; } else if (RunSSH \u0026amp;amp;\u0026amp;amp; IsAllowShell(pw)){ SSHCmd = REQ_SHELL; } else { goto Err; } if (REQ_RSYNC == SSHCmd) { pw = SYNOChgValForRsync(pw); } if (!SSHCanLogin(SSHCmd, pw)) { goto Err; } goto Pass; Err: fprintf(stderr, \u0026#34;Permission denied, please try again.\\n\u0026#34;); exit(1); Pass: #endif /* MY_ABC_HERE */ ... } And here is the IsAllowShell(pw):\nstatic int IsAllowShell(const struct passwd *pw) { struct passwd *pUnPrivilege = NULL; char *szUserName = NULL; if (!pw || !pw-\u0026amp;gt;pw_name) { return 0; } szUserName = pw-\u0026amp;gt;pw_name; if(!strcmp(szUserName, \u0026#34;root\u0026#34;) || !strcmp(szUserName, \u0026#34;admin\u0026#34;)){ return 1; } if (NULL != (pUnPrivilege = getpwnam(szUserName))){ if (!strcmp(pUnPrivilege-\u0026amp;gt;pw_shell, \u0026#34;/bin/sh\u0026#34;) || !strcmp(pUnPrivilege-\u0026amp;gt;pw_shell, \u0026#34;/bin/ash\u0026#34;)) { return 1; } } return 0; } Basically synology created a heavily customized version of OpenSSH, including a handful of hacks - e.g., additional checking before accepting a login to see if the SSH service is enabled within the web interface, or stripping special chars (;, |, \u0026lsquo;) from rsync commands, and\u0026hellip; wait for it\u0026hellip; blocking anyone other than root or admin from using any shell other than /bin/sh or /bin/ash.\nOnce identified the cause, the fix was easy: just remove the call to IsAllowShell(). Cross-compile, upload to the NAS, reboot and voilà, regular users can now use bash normally.\nThe hardest part was to get cross-compiling working properly.

Or you simply don\u0026rsquo;t like the idea of having your port 23 open to the world for god-knows-how-long until a Synology tech support can look into your case.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ve probably tried telneting to your NAS. Maybe you\u0026rsquo;ve even tried opening the case and hacking the serial port, only to discover that you don\u0026rsquo;t have the root password. The DS Assistant password doesn\u0026rsquo;t work, and you exhausted all obvious guesses - blank, synopass, synology, password, admin, root, etc.\nWell, what about c12-0804? No, I didn\u0026rsquo;t make this up. This is today\u0026rsquo;s password.\nBut if you\u0026rsquo;re reading this a few days (or years) from now, too bad; it won\u0026rsquo;t work. Unless, of course, you wait until December 8th. Because the password repeats every year.\nBasically Synology hardcoded a modified login binary within the firmware that accepts an obfuscated password for root, which depends on the current date. (by the way, this isn\u0026rsquo;t the only thing Synology folks hardcoded in the firmware).\nThanks to GPL, Synology was forced to publish the original source code for the firmware. Based on the original correct_password.c code, I hacked a short snippet to generate the daily password.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the Synology Telnet password generator:\n#include \u0026amp;lt;stdlib.h\u0026amp;gt; #include \u0026amp;lt;time.h\u0026amp;gt; #include \u0026amp;lt;stdio.h\u0026amp;gt; void main() { struct timeval tvTime; struct tm tmOutput; gettimeofday(\u0026amp;amp;tvTime, 0); localtime_r(\u0026amp;amp;(tvTime.tv_sec), \u0026amp;amp;tmOutput); tmOutput.tm_mon += 1; printf(\u0026#34;password for today is: %x%02d-%02x%02d\\n\\n\u0026#34;, tmOutput.tm_mon, tmOutput.tm_mon, tmOutput.tm_mday, gcd(tmOutput.tm_mon, tmOutput.tm_mday)); } int gcd(int a, int b) { return (b?gcd(b,a%b):a); } Compile and run the code above with gcc. You can also use the excellent Codepad Repl.it to run the code online and get the password for today (no registration needed).\nBonus tip: if you\u0026rsquo;re curious how exactly the password is generated, here\u0026rsquo;s the algorithm:\n1st character = month in hexadecimal, lower case (1=Jan, \u0026hellip; , a=Oct, b=Nov, c=Dec) 2-3 = month in decimal, zero padded and starting in 1 (01, 02, 03, \u0026hellip;, 11, 12) 4 = dash 5-6 = day of the month in hex (01, 02 .., 0A, .., 1F) 7-8 = greatest common divisor between month and day, zero padded. This is always a number between 01 and 12. So, let\u0026rsquo;s say today is October 15, the password would be: a10-0f05 where a = month in hex, 10 = month in decimal, 0f = day in hex, 05 = greatest divisor between 10 and 15).\nIf you have trouble calculating the greatest common divisor (elementary math, anyone?), Wolfram Alpha is your friend.\nThis was tested on a Synology DS212+, with Marvell Kirkwood mv6282 chipset. It\u0026rsquo;s unlikely but still possible that different models use a different algorithm. YMMV, so always check the source code.\n[UPDATE 1: Several users reported that this works in many other models, including DS409, DS112j, etc. Please leave a comment with your model and firmware version.]\n[UPDATE 2: If it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work, it\u0026rsquo;s probably that your date is incorrect in the NAS. Per Patrick\u0026rsquo;s suggestion in the comments below, try \u0026ldquo;101-0101\u0026rdquo;, which is the password for Jan 01]\n","permalink":"https://wrgms.com/synologys-secret-telnet-password/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIf you have a Synology NAS and had some sort of disk crash in the past, you\u0026rsquo;ve probably encountered the famous \u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;Cannot format system partition\u0026rdquo;\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;Please configure your router to forward port 23 to DiskStation and contact Synology online support\u0026rdquo;\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, it sucks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt sucks even more when you know the disk is perfectly fine, and you still have hopes to recover your data.

The software is robust and much better than my old DroboFS, and the fact that it is entirely open source is a big plus.\nI recently upgraded the firmware to DSM 2661. Everything worked fine. For 12 hours. The next morning, the device was dead, with the blue blink of death).\nWas it the new firmware? Or maybe a disk crash? Who knows.\nI followed the basic tests recommended by Synology: remove both disks, turn it on and wait 30s for a long beep. Beeeeeep. Great, the motherboard is still functional. It also responded to ping and showed up on DS Assistant, so processor and ethernet are also working fine.\nThe Synology DS NAS is basically an embedded Linux box, using md + lvm for RAID. Nothing is proprietary, so I mounted the disks on my Linux desktop and spent a few more hours cloning and re-building the RAID using a spare disk. Life is good.\nTill\u0026hellip; it crashed again.\nThere was something wrong with the system partition, so I wanted to see inside the NAS, before the kernel finishes booting.\nThankfully, Synology folks already put a physical serial port in there. It\u0026rsquo;s not documented, but it\u0026rsquo;s not hard to find. You just have to open the case.\nDisclaimer: make sure you have backup! I am not responsible if you lose your data, void your warranty, burn down your house or kill your dog.\nStart by opening the case. Here\u0026rsquo;s a video with instructions [update: the original video is not available anymore, but here\u0026rsquo;s a similar one]. Be aware this may break the small internal hooks, and you\u0026rsquo;ll need to use tape or hot glue to put it back together (what\u0026rsquo;s wrong with manufacturers these days? What\u0026rsquo;s the problem with good old screws?) Inside the case, look for a 6-pin header, normally labeled JP2 (or COM1 on older models). The pins likely are: Pin Number Function Confirmed on Synology DS212+ \u0026nbsp; 13.3V 2GND 4TX 6RX Now connect the pins 2, 4 and 6 (respectively GNS, TX, RX) to your USB-TTL 3v3 cable (if using the FTDI cable from Adafruit, it\u0026rsquo;ll be 1-black, 5-yellow, 4-orange. Make sure you don\u0026rsquo;t short-circuit any of the pins. These male-female jumper wires could be useful. Open your preferred terminal program (under Win ExtraPutty is the best in town), set to 115200, disable xon/xoff, and you\u0026rsquo;re all set. Now you can turn on your DS, and see all the beauty of what\u0026rsquo;s going on under the hood:\n__ __ _ _ | \\/ | __ _ _ ____ _____| | | | |\\/| |/ _` | \u0026#39;__\\ \\ / / _ \\ | | | | | | (_| | | \\ V / __/ | | |_| |_|\\__,_|_| \\_/ \\___|_|_| _ _ ____ _ | | | | | __ ) ___ ___ | |_ | | | |___| _ \\ / _ \\ / _ \\| __| | |_| |___| |_) | (_) | (_) | |_ \\___/ |____/ \\___/ \\___/ \\__| ** LOADER ** ** MARVELL BOARD: Synology Disk Station LE U-Boot 1.1.4 (Dec 2 2011 - 15:56:02) Marvell version: 3.5.9 U-Boot code: 00600000 -\u0026amp;gt; 0067FFF0 BSS: -\u0026amp;gt; 0068B3D4 Soc: 88F6282 A1CPU running @ 2000Mhz L2 running @ 500Mhz SysClock = 500Mhz , TClock = 200Mhz DRAM (DDR3) CAS Latency = 7 tRP = 7 tRAS = 20 tRCD=7 DRAM CS[0] base 0x00000000 size 256MB DRAM CS[1] base 0x10000000 size 256MB DRAM Total size 512MB 16bit width Addresses 8M - 0M are saved for the U-Boot usage.

It\u0026rsquo;s sad to see so much work and love going nowhere. At least they were classy and wrote a candid and honest shutting-down post, and they\u0026rsquo;re even refunding users (!). That\u0026rsquo;s a level of integrity that you don\u0026rsquo;t see everyday in the startup world.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;ve never played Glitch, it\u0026rsquo;s now too late. The game world is now restricted to existing users, and everything will shut down on December 9th 2012. Here\u0026rsquo;s some videos to give you an idea of what you missed.\nI was part of the first wave of beta testers. Even though I\u0026rsquo;ve never spent much time playing, I remember how every detail was carefullyt thought through, and painstakenly executed. The videos don\u0026rsquo;t do justice to their attention to detail.\nBut, aside from the intrinsic beauty, the gameplay was dull. It was just a cute massive multiplayer social game. Maybe the cutest ever. But without a strong storytelling or any of the gamification tactics from other social gaming companies, there was no reason for you to keep coming back.\nIn a world of \u0026ldquo;Your crops are dying! Your friend Samantha just moved to a farm next door. Invite your friends to level up faster.\u0026rdquo;, it\u0026rsquo;s hard to keep users engaged these days.\nThis reminds me of the Steve Blank\u0026rsquo;s MVP stories. Do you need to develop a full game, with so many levels, intricate dialogues, dozens of non-playable characters, only to realize that your users aren\u0026rsquo;t coming back in the first place?\nCan\u0026rsquo;t you create a demo with a couple of levels and a handful of hard-coded NPCs, and invite your mom/sister/significant other to play? Just check how many times they come back (when you\u0026rsquo;re not looking). You\u0026rsquo;ll achieve the same conclusions, with 10% of the effort.\nOf course hindsight is a bitch \u0026ndash; or, like someone said on HN: \u0026quot;\u0026hellip;hindsight is a Glitch\u0026quot; :). Sometimes you can\u0026rsquo;t just hack an MVP together; you need a fully polished product. But I don\u0026rsquo;t think that\u0026rsquo;s the case here.\nIt seems to me they put too much effort on having a full product, and lost sight of the bigger picture. They repeated some of the same fatal mistakes others have done. For example, Lessons from Habitat outlines many of the same pitfalls, as seen by the creators of Lucasfilm in the mid-80\u0026rsquo;s. The entire paper is a great read, but one part that strikes me as relevant to this discussion:\n\u0026ldquo;While we find much of the work presently being done on elaborate interface technologies \u0026ndash; DataGloves, head-mounted displays, special-purpose rendering engines, and so on \u0026ndash; both exciting and promising, the almost mystical euphoria that currently seems to surround all this hardware is, in our opinion, both excessive and somewhat misplaced.\nWe can\u0026rsquo;t help having a nagging sense that it\u0026rsquo;s all a bit of a distraction from the really pressing issues.\n*At the core of our vision is the idea that cyberspace is necessarily a multiple-participant environment. It seems to us that the things that are important to the inhabitants of such an environment are the capabilities available to them, the characteristics of the other people they encounter there, and the ways these various participants can affect one another.\nBeyond a foundation set of communications capabilities, the details of the technology used to present this environment to its participants, while sexy and interesting, are of relatively peripheral concern.\u0026rdquo;\nKeep in mind the first Habitat was launched in 1986, almost 30 years ago, and ran in 64Kb on a Commodore64.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re now spoiled by Call Of Duty and hyper-realist NBA games. But there\u0026rsquo;s a point to be made that the success of an MMO game is not defined by its level of peripheral sophistication (be it design, cuteness, or head-mounted displays), but by the social experience, and how people interact with each other. Minecraft, with its blocky graphics and limited interactivity, is a prime example.\nGlitch isn\u0026rsquo;t alone in repeating these mistakes. Worlds Chat did the same two decades ago, being the first 3D world ever created. It was later replaced by The Palace. Later Philip Rosedale had his chance with Second Life, which exploded, then burst, and now is becoming cool again (and Philip is trying his hand again with High Fidelity).\nAnother issue with Glitch was its channel distribution. It\u0026rsquo;s challenging in 2012 to succeed with a web-only game, especially if you\u0026rsquo;re not anchored on Facebook. And Glitch was built in Flash (!), so it missed billions of 2-3 minutes slots of free time that people have when waiting for the train, bathroom, elevator.

Sony. HBGary Hack. FBI. Paypal, Visa \u0026amp; MasterCard. Mubarak. Occupy Wall Street. SOPA/PIPA.\nAnonymous has been busy for the past few years. It started as juvenile pranks on 4chan\u0026rsquo;s boards, but grew and became a powerful mechanism against oppressive governments and unscrupulous corporations.\nIts trajectory was beautifully captured in the documentary \u0026ldquo;We Are Legion: The Story of the Hacktivists\u0026rdquo;, that will be released later this year. I had the pleasure to watch the premiere in Austin during SXSW, and I must say - it\u0026rsquo;s f..ing brilliant. The movie is still in post-production, so the theatrical release may be slightly different.\nWe also participated in an exclusive interview with the film director \u0026ldquo;Brian Knappenberger\u0026rdquo;, who was joined on stage by former Anonymous member Gregg Housh and two special guests Anon behind masks: one from Austin, and another just called Anonymous9000, connecting via Skype from an undisclosed location (and using a robotic voice changer). It was a surreal experience.\nTogether they gave a passionate and fascinating perspective of the evolution of Anonymous, its internal workings, and the journey since 4Chan to the present day. They discussed how the group went after the Church of Scientology, why they hacked HBGary, discussed the release of confidential data of Sony customers, and how lately they\u0026rsquo;ve started to engage in social movements around freedom, Occupy Wall Street, the Arab Spring, and the support to Wikileaks\u0026rsquo; founder, Julian Assange.\nA few highlights of the session, in no particular order:\nsome Anons don\u0026rsquo;t agree with the dump of personal information (like in Sony\u0026rsquo;s case). But a few radical sub-groups - like Lulzsec - have a different opinion, and believe the press only pays attention when something concrete happens. Ironically, one of the most vocal supporters of dumping personal data was Sabu - which was revealed last week to be an FBI informant since June 2011. Conflict of interest, maybe?\nAnons in general don\u0026rsquo;t support attacking the press, as they believe in freedom of expression themselves (even when it is press against Anonymous). Some may disagree. Others simply don\u0026rsquo;t care; they\u0026rsquo;re in for the lulz, and accuse others of being moralfags. It\u0026rsquo;s these constant disagreements within Anonymous\u0026rsquo; anarchic structure that gave birth to dissidents, like Lulzsec.\n\u0026ldquo;Thousands of twenty-something socially awkward nerds got laid for the first time due to these movements and events in real life. Behind a mask, they all felt more comfortable in expressing themselves and talking with girls. We saw several marriages between Anons that met while protesting against the Church of Scientology and others\u0026rdquo;.\n\u0026ldquo;The DDoS attacks have just one objective: attract press. Whenever we have a message that we want the press to distribute, we DDoS someone so the press will publish the news that Anonymous attacked again, followed by what we wanted them to communicate. Otherwise we\u0026rsquo;d be just ignored. Look at SOPA/PIPA; we\u0026rsquo;ve been talking about this for years, and no one ever cared. Then we DDoS\u0026rsquo;d RIAA/MPAA/DoJ websites\u0026hellip; and the press showed up in full force overnight.\u0026rdquo;\nWatch the trailer here [YouTube].\nUpdate 2012-11-17: now also available for rental on Vimeo. This is the first time that Vimeo does movie rental. EDIT: Vimeo link is broken, but as of May 2025 it is now available on YouTube.\nUpdate 2012-10-17: it is opening in theatres this weekend. NY, LA, Houston, Canada, Rio de Janeiro and others. Check to see if your city is in the list. You can also pre-order the movie, starting on 10/30.

If you\u0026rsquo;re not one of the 12,000 people already using the service (that\u0026rsquo;s the number Andrea gave during the talk), well\u0026hellip; you should give it a try, because everyone is talking about it. Yeah, I live in the echo chamber, I know.\nGlancee, like its competitors Highlight, Sonar, Banjo, are all exploring the new niche of location social discovery - some sort of Match.com-meets-LinkedIn. Unproven territory, but sounds promising (albeit somewhat dystopian) to me. Andrea spoke about the current status of social discovery apps and the different approaches taken by each player. He also mentioned the incredible growth (hard to see 12,000 as incredible, but startup founders have to drink their own Kool-Aid), particularly with all the buzz around SXSW.\nBut to me the most interesting tidbit was the concept of monetizing the service via Spatial Analysis.\nHe didn\u0026rsquo;t elaborate much, so let me speculate a bit here. Consider that you have a device on your pocket that is connected to Facebook (i.e. knows everything about your attitudinal behavior - including Likes, affinity with brands, reach, friends). You have Glancee installed, and as such it is constantly broadcasting your current geolocation. Every. Single. Minute. Like Google Latitude, but with a Facebook social layer on top of it.\nNot only it knows who you are and what you like, but also where you\u0026rsquo;ve been, where you work, live, play, study, shop, your the preferred gas station, and countries you\u0026rsquo;ve travelled.\nAll this leads to a level of geospatial analysis never seen before, using all your social graph as an extra dimension. You could plot heatmaps showing location of people that liked your brand on FB, and use to optimize out-of-home media placement. Or monitor the consumers of a competitor brand when planning new physical stores. Basically it\u0026rsquo;s any marketer\u0026rsquo;s dream come true.\nOf course, it has just one small problem: it needs permission, and critical mass. You need tens of millions of users using the service, in order to have a meaningful representation.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why Andreas was so adamant when I asked him about his number one goal: \u0026ldquo;Growth. And fast\u0026rdquo;.\nUpdate 2012-05-04: it seems Facebook may agree with me here \u0026ndash; Facebook just announced they\u0026rsquo;re acquiring Glancee. I guess Andrea can scratch off \u0026ldquo;Growth\u0026rdquo; from his list.\n","permalink":"https://wrgms.com/glancee/","summary":"\u003ccenter\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Glancee at SXSW\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/content/images/2014/Feb/glancee.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/center\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy last session of SXSW Day 2 was with \u003ca href=\"http://andreavaccari.com/\"\u003eAndrea Vaccari\u003c/a\u003e, the CEO of the trendy location-based discovery startup \u003ca href=\"http://www.glancee.com/\"\u003eGlancee\u003c/a\u003e.

But despite recent progress with Content Network and YouTube, the marketing community still see the search giant as a way to drive conversion at the bottom of the funnel. In order to move to the next level, Google has to prove they can create emotional connections with consumers.\nEnter Project Re:Brief, just announced during SXSW.\nAccording to Aman Govil, Google\u0026rsquo;s Product Marketing Manager, the idea was to \u0026ldquo;re-imagine iconic campaigns of 4 classic global brands through the lenses of modern technology\u0026rdquo;. The project aims to be a benchmark of what is possible when you have the right idea and the perfect balance between creativity \u0026amp; technology.\nThe brands were carefully selected: Coca-Cola with Hilltop, Volvo with Drive it like you hate it, Avis We try harder, and Alka-Seltzer I can\u0026rsquo;t believe I ate the whole thing. The secret sauce was that they brought back from retirement the original creators of these 4 campaigns, and paired them with digital creatives, so they could re-imagine their original creations, leveraging today\u0026rsquo;s technology.\nIt was fascinating to see people like Harvey Gabor (Coca-Cola\u0026rsquo;s Hilltop, 1971) working with a bunch of twenty-something, and discovering how to use touch screens, mobile, realtime web.\nI had the opportunity to chat with Aman and Drew (the global creative director for the new campaigns) to understand how they pulled it together. Surprisingly, each project took just 2-3 months, and were executed with a relatively small budget (\u0026ldquo;Less than a TV spots\u0026rdquo;, told me Drew). Seems the advertisers were initially resistant to touch iconic pieces like Hilltop, but eventually understood the spirit of the project, and loved the opportunity to work with the original creators.\nWhat is even more fascinating is that not a single can of Coke or Alka-Seltzer was sold because this initiative. Google pulled this off not to help their clients sell more, but to help themseves. The target audience was marketers and agencies, hoping they would talk, comment, write blog posts. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t get more meta than this.\nCheck out more at www.projectrebrief.com, and look for the documentary later this year.\nUpdate 2012-06-22: the full documentary is now available on YouTube.\n","permalink":"https://wrgms.com/rebrief/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/content/images/2014/Feb/google_rebrief-1.png\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the past years Google has been trying to go beyond search, diversifying their revenue sources.

It took me some time to make it work like I wanted (keyboard, extensions, application menu, etc), but I\u0026rsquo;m quite happy with everything. Or almost everything.\nOne thing I enjoyed over the years was the ability to customize my keyboard shortcuts. I have dozens of shotcuts - to center windows on my screen, to open programs, start and stop Spotify, to run macros, to log in to my remote servers, and so on.\nOne of my handy shortcuts is \u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;F1\u0026gt; to open an xterm with superuser, and \u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;F2\u0026gt; for regular user. I use custom xterm profiles, so I can easily check if I\u0026rsquo;m running under a privileged context by looking at the color of the window.\nThis worked well for years under Ubuntu 14.04 and Gnome 3.20, but stopped working with the upgrade to Bionic Beaver. More specifically, \u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;F1\u0026gt; is now System Help, with no way to change it.\n\u0026ldquo;No problem\u0026rdquo;, I thought; this can be easily adjusted in System Settings.\nNops.\nI searched around, and found other folks with the same problem, but no solution.\nI then decided to dug into the source code, and discovered the improbable: Gnome devs decided the help was so important that it deserved its own unique, hardcoded, and immutable shortcut. If you want to reassign it, you\u0026rsquo;re out of luck.\nAccording to gnome-settings-daemon changelog:\n=============== Version 3.21.90 =============== ... Media keys: - Add Super+F1 as a hardcoded shortcut for launching Help ... REALLY? What\u0026rsquo;s wrong with a default icon in the toolbar, or maybe a popup window when you boot for the first time? Also, does anyone really care about reading the basic documentation for\u0026hellip; a windows manager?\nI wasn\u0026rsquo;t convinced yet, but a closer look at the source code confirmed my fear: there it was: (file /gnome-settings-daemon/blob/master/plugins/media-keys/shortcuts-list.h):\n{ HELP_KEY, NULL, N_(\u0026#34;Help\u0026#34;), \u0026#34;\u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;F1\u0026#34;, GSD_ACTION_MODE_LAUNCHER }, So if you\u0026rsquo;re really determined to regain control of your \u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;F1\u0026gt;, there\u0026rsquo;s only one solution: to recompile gnome-settings-daemon, and replace the gsd-media-keys plugin. Spoiler alert: I\u0026rsquo;m glad to report that my patch was successful, but beware: getting the right dependencies and recompiling Gnome is not an easy feat. Keep reading if you\u0026rsquo;re interested in doing the same:\nDownload and install Gnome Builder Click on \u0026ldquo;Clone\u0026rdquo;, select a local directory (e.g., ~/Projects/) and use the official repo at https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-settings-daemon Open xterm, and enter cd ~/Projects/gnome-settings-daemon; git checkout tags/GNOME_SETTINGS_DAEMON_3_28_1 (you can check your exact version with gnome-shell --version. Check all tags available with git tag -l) Install all dependencies. These were the ones missing in my system, but YMMV: apt install libcolord-dev \\ libgeocode-glib-dev \\ gnome-desktop3-data \\ libgnome-desktop-3-dev \\ libgweather-3-dev \\ libcanberra-gtk3-dev \\ libgeoclue-2-dev \\ libnotify-dev \\ libpulse-mainloop-glib0 \\ libpulse-dev \\ gobject-introspection \\ libupower-glib-dev \\ libpolkit-gobject-1-dev \\ libasound2-dev \\ libgudev-1.0-dev \\ libwacom-dev \\ libnss3-dev \\ libcups2-dev \\ libnm-dev Patch the source code by editing ~/Projects/gnome-settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/shortcuts-list.h, and add a comment in front of the offender, like below (for Gnome 3.28.1 it is in line 69): // disabled! // { HELP_KEY, NULL, N_(\u0026#34;Help\u0026#34;), \u0026#34;\u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;F1\u0026#34;, GSD_ACTION_MODE_LAUNCHER }, Click [Rebuild] button in the Builder UI to compile (note: you need to click Rebuild, and not Build). You may want to turn off the deprecation warnings by editing meson.build and adding '-Wno-deprecated-declarations' to test_cflags = [...]; (line 70). If you installed all the dependencies correctly, you should have no warnings nor errors. Find the compiled binaries. You\u0026rsquo;re looking specifically for the plugin gsd-media-keys, so it\u0026rsquo;ll likely be in the directory ~/.var/app/org.gnome.Builder/cache/gnome-builder/projects/gnome-settings-daemon/builds/default-host-HEAD/plugins/media-keys cd ~/.var/app/org.gnome.Builder/cache/gnome-builder/projects/gnome-settings-daemon/builds/default-host-HEAD/plugins/media-keys ~ cp ./gsd-media-keys ~/gsd-media-keys.patched Before proceeding, you may want to inspect your binary to confirm it successfully linked with shared libraries by using ldd ~/gsd-media-keys.patched. In my case I had problems finding libgsd.so, so I solved it by adding the path to ldconfig (although the correct solution would be to fix this in the build system): sudo sh -c \u0026#39;echo \u0026#34;# gnome-settings-daemon\\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gnome-settings-daemon-3.0/\\n\u0026#34; \u0026gt; /etc/ld.so.conf.d/gnome-settings-daemon.conf\u0026#39; sudo ldconfig You\u0026rsquo;re now ready to install the patched gsd-media-keys binary in your system: cd /usr/lib/gnome-settings-daemon/ sudo mv ~/gsd-media-keys.patched . sudo strip -s ./gsd-media-keys.patched sudo mv gsd-media-keys gsd-media-keys.orig sudo ln -s gsd-media-keys.patched gsd-media-keys Log out or reboot, and you\u0026rsquo;re done! If all goes well, your system now should be running the gsd-media-keys plugin without the \u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;F1\u0026gt; hardcoded, so you can reassign to anything you like.\nIf anything goes wrong and you can\u0026rsquo;t log in, don\u0026rsquo;t despair. Simply open a console terminal by using \u0026lt;Ctrl\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;Alt\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;F2\u0026gt; and restore your original gsd-media-keys binary by doing:\ncd /usr/lib/gnome-settings-daemon/ sudo rm gsd-media-keys sudo ln -s gsd-media-keys.orig gsd-media-keys Use \u0026lt;Ctrl\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;Alt\u0026gt;\u0026lt;F1\u0026gt; to go back to Gnome and log in again. You can then inspect /var/log/syslog to understand what went wrong (search for \u0026ldquo;media-keys\u0026rdquo;). It\u0026rsquo;s likely that you had problems with the dynamic libraries in step 8 above.\n","permalink":"https://wrgms.com/fixing-gnome-3-2x-hardcoded-superf1-shortcut/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eUbuntu 18.04 LTS is finally out, and with it you now have Gnome out of the box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve been using Gnome for several years, and have enjoyed its minimalism.

You may smile. But it will come…” [Henry Ford, 1940]\nFlying cars are not something new. The idea has been going around since the 19th century, even before the very first flight by Santos-Dumont (or Wright Brothers, depending on your bias). But it was The Jetsons who first brought the concept of flying cars to the masses. We grew up dreaming that one day we\u0026rsquo;d be able to get in our cars and fly straight to our destination - fast, safely, and traffic-free.\nThanks to Moore\u0026rsquo;s Law and the latest advances in engineering, we may be closer to flying cars than you think.\nAeroMobil is an innovative company from Slovakia, founded by Štefan Klein and Juraj Vaculik. Štefan, a well-known designer for Audi, Volkswagen and BMW, has been pursuing this idea for more than two decades. Juraj has a long and successful track record in advertising and as an investor. The two minds came together to create the company and make the dream a reality.\nDuring his talk at SXSW today, Juraj talked about the latest advances and their recent flying prototypes. As you can see on the two videos below, they made quite a progress between version 2.5 (early 2013) and 3.0 (late 2014).\nAeroMobil 2.5:\nAeroMobil 3.0: (note that Štefan himself test drives every prototype. He believes no one understand the machines better than him)\nDespite the progress, don\u0026rsquo;t expect to be driving - err.. flying - just yet. There are still several roadblocks (no pun intended) before mass adoption. They still need to figure out logistical challenges, like fueling stations, or grass strips next to roads for landing and take off. And change legislations, and define new testing procedures and certification. Or get people certified as pilots (yeah, don\u0026rsquo;t think your driver\u0026rsquo;s license will fly).\nBut with Google investing so heavily in self-driving cars, and SpaceX sending rockets to space, it\u0026rsquo;s not hard to imagine these efforts converging and eventually giving birth to self-driving flying cars. It might sound crazy at first, but there\u0026rsquo;s a good chance we\u0026rsquo;ll see it in our lifetime. AeroMobil may be in the exact spot that Paul Graham calls a Frighteningly Ambitious Startup Idea.\nCrazy? Yes.

With 800+ sessions this year, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to get overwhelmed. But get over your FOMO, and enjoy the serendipity. You will miss many good sessions, and that\u0026rsquo;s OK. The best talk will be that one you didn\u0026rsquo;t plan, and just entered because your first option was full.\nSpeaking of crowded sessions: always have a plan B. Your first option will likely be full, so having a second/third option is always important.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t go to panels. Ever. There\u0026rsquo;s hardly enough time for one person to convey a good idea in under 60 minutes. 4 or 5 becomes a festival of shallow sound bites. You already have Twitter for those.\nSeek geeky and obscure talks. The less buzzwords on the description, the better. Extra points if the talk is by someone who is actually making things - rather than people talking about those who made it. I saw some unbelievably good sessions in the past which had less 20 participants in the audience.\nBring an extra battery pack. Your phone will die midday, even if you have an iPhone 6 Plus. Pack some extra juice.\nPlan your commute time between sessions. Some venues are 2 miles away from Austin Convention Center, and shuttles may take 15-30 min door-to-door. Try Lyft/Uber, or pedicabs. Or you can be ultra-hipster and apply for a loaner Boosted Board. I already secured mine!\nDriving is usually a bad idea. Parking is expensive, and you may want to have a beer or two (or six or ten). Get an Uber/Lyft, or use the official shuttles, but be prepared to spend one hour each way. And remind yourself next time to book your ticket the exact minute they go on sale, and enjoy the convenience of a hotel in walking distance.\nHave a good breakfast. You won\u0026rsquo;t eat much during the day, and you\u0026rsquo;re probably still recovering from last night.\nRSVPs are usually useless. Most of the parties don\u0026rsquo;t require RSVP, and use it just to collect email addresses. And the ones that do are not the ones you see on blogs. [EDIT: this used to be true, but it\u0026rsquo;s now starting to change. Many parties are now respecting RSVPs, and even many of the talks in the official program started to require reservation, so play safe and do your homework.]\nRemember: SXSW is a marathon, not a sprint. It\u0026rsquo;s 5 full days (double if you do Music/Film), so take time to enjoy yourself. It\u0026rsquo;s Spring, and there\u0026rsquo;s no better time to be in Austin.

The requirements are:\nMust be able to listen continuously Run on embedded ARM processors (particuarly Raspberry Pi and BeagleBone Black) Good accuracy on a limited set of words (English only) Decent performance, particularly on low-power CPUs My first thought was to use Google Speech API. The accuracy is great, and it\u0026rsquo;s reasonably fast. But it is also limited to only 50 calls per day, so it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t satisfy requirement #1. And I don\u0026rsquo;t like the idea of streaming all of my personal conversations to anyone. It\u0026rsquo;s already enough to have NSA listening to my phone calls\u0026hellip;\n(maybe it\u0026rsquo;s an option for the future, when implementing something with a physical push-button, like a Star Trek communicator device)\nSiriProxy is another neat hack, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work with iOS7/8 anymore. Apple will soon offer an official interface to Siri via its HomeKit program, but it\u0026rsquo;ll only work with licensed hardware. Likely not an option for hackers and personal projects.\nAfter some research, I found CMUSphinx project, which seems to be the best project in the area of voice recognition. PocketSphinx toolkit is the version you want for embedded CPUs, as it\u0026rsquo;s pure C, and rather portable.\nThe documentation is not very friendly, but once you get it going, it works well.\nThe first step is to download and install SphinxBase, followed by PocketSphinx. The README has instructions to compile and install, but it\u0026rsquo;s the basic\n./configure make make install By default it\u0026rsquo;ll install binaries to /usr/local/bin, and language models to /usr/local/share. Make sure you have swig and alsa drivers installed before starting (apt-get install swig alsa-base alsa-utils).\nOnce installed, you need to figure out which dictionary model you want to use. Just for testing, I created a dictionary with 106 words, based on the old Logo language (remember the Logo turtle?), like forward, backward, turn right, turn left, etc.\nBefore you can start training PocketSphinx, you\u0026rsquo;ll need an acoustic model. Sadly, the speech corpus (i.e., audio files with spoken words) used to train the models are usually closed source. So either you spend a couple of hours recording the voices (or using an4/Voxforge) to train your own model, or you\u0026rsquo;ll skip this entirely and just use some of the built-in models, accepting lower accuracy. Given my limited number of words in the dictionary, I decided to go with built in acoustic models.\nNext, you need to describe your Language Model - the words, grammar, and frequency of words that you want to recognize. This tutorial has more details. If you\u0026rsquo;re in a hurry and just want to get PocketSphinx going with a dictionary for your pre-defined words, save yourself some trouble and use the online lmtool. This webservice will allow you to upload your dictionary file (a simple ASCII file, with one sentence or word per line), and it\u0026rsquo;ll generate all the language models you need to run PocketSphinx.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a sample of my dictionary file:\nannounce answer ask back clipboard color copy count ... sentence set space square root stamp wait wait until when who word If you want to play with this dictionary, download these files here, and run:\npocketsphinx_continuous -lm lm/logo.lm -dict lm/logo.dic (note: if pocketsphinx is stuck at READY, it\u0026rsquo;s probably listening to the wrong hw device. Check where is the microphone attached via cat /proc/asound/cards, and add -adcdev plughw:X,0 to the line above, replacing X by the hardware id of your microphone).\npocketsphinx_continuous -lm lm/logo.lm -dict lm/logo.dic -adcdev plughw:2,0 Smartphones use all sorts of tricks to cancel the background noise, but that requires special hardware, so you\u0026rsquo;ll need a reasonable quiet environment. Otherwise the accuracy will suffer, depending on how large your dictionary is.\nAs you would expect, smaller dictionaries have much better accuracy. With a 100-word, I got 60-70% correct. After I reduced to a simple 15-words dictionary, I got virtually 100% match rate, even with some background noise and a non-American accent. Certainly enough for my projects.\nNext up: running this on a Raspberry Pi, installing a decent openair microphone, and testing overall performance when connected to a home automation system.

It\u0026rsquo;s a shame that Linux keyboard is still horribly broken by default (some may say it\u0026rsquo;s by design; no, it\u0026rsquo;s not).\nIt has been asked before, but most answers will point you to use xim, which will open another can of worms.

Some say it\u0026rsquo;ll the the digital renaissance; others claim it\u0026rsquo;s the best thing to ever happen to the web, after the browser itself.\nThis video summarizes well the sentiment:\nThis is wrong.\nTen years from now we\u0026rsquo;ll look back and realize how much the new gTLDs have hurt us.\nFirst, most of the new gTLDs add little or no value. I bet we could live another 50 years without a .ninja, a .soy, .fail, .florist, or .loans.\nOthers will proclaim that the new gTLDs are useful, and point to domains like .nyc, .london, or .website, as examples of the \u0026ldquo;democratization\u0026rdquo; promoted by the new categories.\nBut these will be the exception rather than the rule. In practice the new gTLDS will force brands to spend millions of dollars to protect against cybersquatters rushing to claim new brand-related domains, amongst other threats.\nBefore you had to register your brand across a handful of TLDs. Now you have 1,400 more to worry about. That\u0026rsquo;s like a whack-a-mole game, but you\u0026rsquo;re outnumbered by hundreds of moles for each hand you have.\nAnd yet, this is not my main concern. Brands got screwed and will spend a ton of money, while domain registrars will be laughing all the way to the bank. Whatever, life will be fine.\nMy concern is a different one: the new gTLDs will accelerate the demise of the URI.\nWe already lost users to search. It\u0026rsquo;s more convenient to type \u0026ldquo;Brand\u0026rdquo; on the browser and let your search engine do the rest than typing \u0026ldquo;brand.com\u0026rdquo;. And on mobile the URL is already hidden from the user, as if it were an irrelevant technical implementation detail. Same on Safari on desktop.\nBut now multiply this situation by thousands of gTLDs, and you\u0026rsquo;ll have the perfect Paradox of Choice. Is it a .com, a .net, .cc? Nops. Keep going friend.\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s add to the mix the fact that a) most of the mobile traffic is already coming from native apps, and b) Apple is pushing to bury the URI, and c) Google is replacing everything by its omni-search. And we\u0026rsquo;re not even talking about Siri or voice-activated search. This will result in a very different world. My prediction: thanks to the new gTLDs, mobile apps and commercial players will have even more control than today, and URLs will be demoted to second-class citizens. They will still be there, but buried somewhere in the sub-menus of your browser, or the API of your Chrome extensions. Just like IP addresses; you know it\u0026rsquo;s there somewhere, but nobody cares.\nIn the name of find-ability and ease of use, we\u0026rsquo;ll live in an URL-less world. And commercial entities will be rewarded and profit from your traffic.\nI\u0026rsquo;m sure that\u0026rsquo;s not the web that Sir Tim Berners-Lee envisioned 25 years ago.\n","permalink":"https://wrgms.com/gtlds-and-the-death-of-urls/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eUnless you\u0026rsquo;ve been living under a rock, you\u0026rsquo;ve read \u003cem\u003ead nauseum\u003c/em\u003e about the overly optimistic predictions for the new gTLDs.

Wrong.\nBut this time I was the one to blame.\nAfter solving the conflict with bash, I changed /etc/passwd user shell to /bin/bash. The only problem is that Synology wipes the system partition during firmware upgrades, so when I upgraded to DSM 4.1.2668, my custom `/bin/bash``was gone. Of course this locked me out of the system. No SSH, SCP or FTP. Great.\nAfter a few moments of panic, I remembered I still had the serial console. So I could put Linux in single user mode, and drop into recovery mode.\nSo if you\u0026rsquo;re ever in a similar situation, here\u0026rsquo;s how to fix it:\n1. First, you need a serial console.\n2. During U-Boot, press any key to cancel the automatic kernel boot (Hit any key to stop autoboot).\n3. Enter printenv to check the environment variables. Search for bootargs and bootm variables (they will be different on your system, so do NOT copy and paste from mine, unless you have a Synology DS212+ with the same DSM).\n4. Append reboot=cold,hard emergency init=/bin/sh to the end of bootargs variable. In my case, this is what I used:\nsetenv bootargs \u0026#39;console=ttyS0,115200 ip=off initrd=0x00800040,4M root=/dev/md0 rw syno_hw_version=DS212pv20 ihd_num=2 netif_num=1 esata_7042=1 reboot=cold,hard emergency init=/bin/sh\u0026#39; (again, your parameters will likely be different, so don\u0026rsquo;t copy and paste)\n5. Boot your kernel, with\nbootm F8080000 F8280000 Now your Synology should be happily botting in single user mode, ignoring /etc/passwd and dropping you to a plain shell. Do what you have to do to fix the system, and reboot.\nYou can also use these steps to recover your system partition from a crash or other problem.\n","permalink":"https://wrgms.com/entering-single-user-mode-on-a-synology/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/content/images/2019/06/upowerd.png\"\u003e\n\u003cimg alt=\"alt text\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/content/images/2013/01/synology.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hope this will be my last post about Synology for a while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter dealing for a few weeks with an \u003ca href=\"http://forum.synology.com/enu/viewtopic.php?f=221\u0026amp;t=59808\u0026amp;start=45#p232455\"\u003eunstable environment\u003c/a\u003e, then \u003ca href=\"/recovering-a-failed-synology-diskstation-ds2xx-serial\"\u003ehacking a serial console\u003c/a\u003e to troubleshoot, then \u003ca href=\"/synologys-secret-telnet-password/\"\u003ecracking the secret recovery telnet password\u003c/a\u003e just for fun, and finally solving the \u003ca href=\"http://serverfault.com/questions/458553/cant-log-in-via-ssh-to-any-accounts-set-to-use-bin-bash-as-a-default-shell/\"\u003eweird mistery\u003c/a\u003e of SSH \u003ca href=\"/reverse-engineering-synology-openssh\"\u003enot accepting /bin/bash as default shell\u003c/a\u003e, I thought I finally had a stable environment.

The user has to be called \u0026ldquo;root\u0026rdquo;.\nWHAAAT?\nThankfully, Synology uses a modified Linux distribution, so they publish the code under GPL.\nAfter a couple of hours looking at the OpenSSH source code, things became pretty obvious. Here\u0026rsquo;s the piece of code from their version of OpenSSH 5.8p1, file session.c:\nvoid do_child(Session *s, const char *command) { ... #ifdef MY_ABC_HERE char szValue[8]; int RunSSH = 0; SSH_CMD SSHCmd = REQ_UNKNOWN; if (1 == GetKeyValue(\u0026#34;/etc/synoinfo.conf\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;runssh\u0026#34;, szValue, sizeof(szValue))) { if (strcasecmp(szValue, \u0026#34;yes\u0026#34;) == 0) { RunSSH = 1; } } if (IsSFTPReq(command)){ SSHCmd = REQ_SFTP; } else if (IsRsyncReq(command)){ SSHCmd = REQ_RSYNC; } else if (IsTimebkpRequest(command)){ SSHCmd = REQ_TIMEBKP; } else if (RunSSH \u0026amp;amp;\u0026amp;amp; IsAllowShell(pw)){ SSHCmd = REQ_SHELL; } else { goto Err; } if (REQ_RSYNC == SSHCmd) { pw = SYNOChgValForRsync(pw); } if (!SSHCanLogin(SSHCmd, pw)) { goto Err; } goto Pass; Err: fprintf(stderr, \u0026#34;Permission denied, please try again.\\n\u0026#34;); exit(1); Pass: #endif /* MY_ABC_HERE */ ... } And here is the IsAllowShell(pw):\nstatic int IsAllowShell(const struct passwd *pw) { struct passwd *pUnPrivilege = NULL; char *szUserName = NULL; if (!pw || !pw-\u0026amp;gt;pw_name) { return 0; } szUserName = pw-\u0026amp;gt;pw_name; if(!strcmp(szUserName, \u0026#34;root\u0026#34;) || !strcmp(szUserName, \u0026#34;admin\u0026#34;)){ return 1; } if (NULL != (pUnPrivilege = getpwnam(szUserName))){ if (!strcmp(pUnPrivilege-\u0026amp;gt;pw_shell, \u0026#34;/bin/sh\u0026#34;) || !strcmp(pUnPrivilege-\u0026amp;gt;pw_shell, \u0026#34;/bin/ash\u0026#34;)) { return 1; } } return 0; } Basically synology created a heavily customized version of OpenSSH, including a handful of hacks - e.g., additional checking before accepting a login to see if the SSH service is enabled within the web interface, or stripping special chars (;, |, \u0026lsquo;) from rsync commands, and\u0026hellip; wait for it\u0026hellip; blocking anyone other than root or admin from using any shell other than /bin/sh or /bin/ash.\nOnce identified the cause, the fix was easy: just remove the call to IsAllowShell(). Cross-compile, upload to the NAS, reboot and voilà, regular users can now use bash normally.\nThe hardest part was to get cross-compiling working properly.

Or you simply don\u0026rsquo;t like the idea of having your port 23 open to the world for god-knows-how-long until a Synology tech support can look into your case.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ve probably tried telneting to your NAS. Maybe you\u0026rsquo;ve even tried opening the case and hacking the serial port, only to discover that you don\u0026rsquo;t have the root password. The DS Assistant password doesn\u0026rsquo;t work, and you exhausted all obvious guesses - blank, synopass, synology, password, admin, root, etc.\nWell, what about c12-0804? No, I didn\u0026rsquo;t make this up. This is today\u0026rsquo;s password.\nBut if you\u0026rsquo;re reading this a few days (or years) from now, too bad; it won\u0026rsquo;t work. Unless, of course, you wait until December 8th. Because the password repeats every year.\nBasically Synology hardcoded a modified login binary within the firmware that accepts an obfuscated password for root, which depends on the current date. (by the way, this isn\u0026rsquo;t the only thing Synology folks hardcoded in the firmware).\nThanks to GPL, Synology was forced to publish the original source code for the firmware. Based on the original correct_password.c code, I hacked a short snippet to generate the daily password.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the Synology Telnet password generator:\n#include \u0026amp;lt;stdlib.h\u0026amp;gt; #include \u0026amp;lt;time.h\u0026amp;gt; #include \u0026amp;lt;stdio.h\u0026amp;gt; void main() { struct timeval tvTime; struct tm tmOutput; gettimeofday(\u0026amp;amp;tvTime, 0); localtime_r(\u0026amp;amp;(tvTime.tv_sec), \u0026amp;amp;tmOutput); tmOutput.tm_mon += 1; printf(\u0026#34;password for today is: %x%02d-%02x%02d\\n\\n\u0026#34;, tmOutput.tm_mon, tmOutput.tm_mon, tmOutput.tm_mday, gcd(tmOutput.tm_mon, tmOutput.tm_mday)); } int gcd(int a, int b) { return (b?gcd(b,a%b):a); } Compile and run the code above with gcc. You can also use the excellent Codepad Repl.it to run the code online and get the password for today (no registration needed).\nBonus tip: if you\u0026rsquo;re curious how exactly the password is generated, here\u0026rsquo;s the algorithm:\n1st character = month in hexadecimal, lower case (1=Jan, \u0026hellip; , a=Oct, b=Nov, c=Dec) 2-3 = month in decimal, zero padded and starting in 1 (01, 02, 03, \u0026hellip;, 11, 12) 4 = dash 5-6 = day of the month in hex (01, 02 .., 0A, .., 1F) 7-8 = greatest common divisor between month and day, zero padded. This is always a number between 01 and 12. So, let\u0026rsquo;s say today is October 15, the password would be: a10-0f05 where a = month in hex, 10 = month in decimal, 0f = day in hex, 05 = greatest divisor between 10 and 15).\nIf you have trouble calculating the greatest common divisor (elementary math, anyone?), Wolfram Alpha is your friend.\nThis was tested on a Synology DS212+, with Marvell Kirkwood mv6282 chipset. It\u0026rsquo;s unlikely but still possible that different models use a different algorithm. YMMV, so always check the source code.\n[UPDATE 1: Several users reported that this works in many other models, including DS409, DS112j, etc. Please leave a comment with your model and firmware version.]\n[UPDATE 2: If it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work, it\u0026rsquo;s probably that your date is incorrect in the NAS. Per Patrick\u0026rsquo;s suggestion in the comments below, try \u0026ldquo;101-0101\u0026rdquo;, which is the password for Jan 01]\n","permalink":"https://wrgms.com/synologys-secret-telnet-password/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIf you have a Synology NAS and had some sort of disk crash in the past, you\u0026rsquo;ve probably encountered the famous \u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;Cannot format system partition\u0026rdquo;\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;Please configure your router to forward port 23 to DiskStation and contact Synology online support\u0026rdquo;\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, it sucks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt sucks even more when you know the disk is perfectly fine, and you still have hopes to recover your data.

The software is robust and much better than my old DroboFS, and the fact that it is entirely open source is a big plus.\nI recently upgraded the firmware to DSM 2661. Everything worked fine. For 12 hours. The next morning, the device was dead, with the blue blink of death).\nWas it the new firmware? Or maybe a disk crash? Who knows.\nI followed the basic tests recommended by Synology: remove both disks, turn it on and wait 30s for a long beep. Beeeeeep. Great, the motherboard is still functional. It also responded to ping and showed up on DS Assistant, so processor and ethernet are also working fine.\nThe Synology DS NAS is basically an embedded Linux box, using md + lvm for RAID. Nothing is proprietary, so I mounted the disks on my Linux desktop and spent a few more hours cloning and re-building the RAID using a spare disk. Life is good.\nTill\u0026hellip; it crashed again.\nThere was something wrong with the system partition, so I wanted to see inside the NAS, before the kernel finishes booting.\nThankfully, Synology folks already put a physical serial port in there. It\u0026rsquo;s not documented, but it\u0026rsquo;s not hard to find. You just have to open the case.\nDisclaimer: make sure you have backup! I am not responsible if you lose your data, void your warranty, burn down your house or kill your dog.\nStart by opening the case. Here\u0026rsquo;s a video with instructions [update: the original video is not available anymore, but here\u0026rsquo;s a similar one]. Be aware this may break the small internal hooks, and you\u0026rsquo;ll need to use tape or hot glue to put it back together (what\u0026rsquo;s wrong with manufacturers these days? What\u0026rsquo;s the problem with good old screws?) Inside the case, look for a 6-pin header, normally labeled JP2 (or COM1 on older models). The pins likely are: Pin Number Function Confirmed on Synology DS212+ \u0026nbsp; 13.3V 2GND 4TX 6RX Now connect the pins 2, 4 and 6 (respectively GNS, TX, RX) to your USB-TTL 3v3 cable (if using the FTDI cable from Adafruit, it\u0026rsquo;ll be 1-black, 5-yellow, 4-orange. Make sure you don\u0026rsquo;t short-circuit any of the pins. These male-female jumper wires could be useful. Open your preferred terminal program (under Win ExtraPutty is the best in town), set to 115200, disable xon/xoff, and you\u0026rsquo;re all set. Now you can turn on your DS, and see all the beauty of what\u0026rsquo;s going on under the hood:\n__ __ _ _ | \\/ | __ _ _ ____ _____| | | | |\\/| |/ _` | \u0026#39;__\\ \\ / / _ \\ | | | | | | (_| | | \\ V / __/ | | |_| |_|\\__,_|_| \\_/ \\___|_|_| _ _ ____ _ | | | | | __ ) ___ ___ | |_ | | | |___| _ \\ / _ \\ / _ \\| __| | |_| |___| |_) | (_) | (_) | |_ \\___/ |____/ \\___/ \\___/ \\__| ** LOADER ** ** MARVELL BOARD: Synology Disk Station LE U-Boot 1.1.4 (Dec 2 2011 - 15:56:02) Marvell version: 3.5.9 U-Boot code: 00600000 -\u0026amp;gt; 0067FFF0 BSS: -\u0026amp;gt; 0068B3D4 Soc: 88F6282 A1CPU running @ 2000Mhz L2 running @ 500Mhz SysClock = 500Mhz , TClock = 200Mhz DRAM (DDR3) CAS Latency = 7 tRP = 7 tRAS = 20 tRCD=7 DRAM CS[0] base 0x00000000 size 256MB DRAM CS[1] base 0x10000000 size 256MB DRAM Total size 512MB 16bit width Addresses 8M - 0M are saved for the U-Boot usage.

It\u0026rsquo;s sad to see so much work and love going nowhere. At least they were classy and wrote a candid and honest shutting-down post, and they\u0026rsquo;re even refunding users (!). That\u0026rsquo;s a level of integrity that you don\u0026rsquo;t see everyday in the startup world.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;ve never played Glitch, it\u0026rsquo;s now too late. The game world is now restricted to existing users, and everything will shut down on December 9th 2012. Here\u0026rsquo;s some videos to give you an idea of what you missed.\nI was part of the first wave of beta testers. Even though I\u0026rsquo;ve never spent much time playing, I remember how every detail was carefullyt thought through, and painstakenly executed. The videos don\u0026rsquo;t do justice to their attention to detail.\nBut, aside from the intrinsic beauty, the gameplay was dull. It was just a cute massive multiplayer social game. Maybe the cutest ever. But without a strong storytelling or any of the gamification tactics from other social gaming companies, there was no reason for you to keep coming back.\nIn a world of \u0026ldquo;Your crops are dying! Your friend Samantha just moved to a farm next door. Invite your friends to level up faster.\u0026rdquo;, it\u0026rsquo;s hard to keep users engaged these days.\nThis reminds me of the Steve Blank\u0026rsquo;s MVP stories. Do you need to develop a full game, with so many levels, intricate dialogues, dozens of non-playable characters, only to realize that your users aren\u0026rsquo;t coming back in the first place?\nCan\u0026rsquo;t you create a demo with a couple of levels and a handful of hard-coded NPCs, and invite your mom/sister/significant other to play? Just check how many times they come back (when you\u0026rsquo;re not looking). You\u0026rsquo;ll achieve the same conclusions, with 10% of the effort.\nOf course hindsight is a bitch \u0026ndash; or, like someone said on HN: \u0026quot;\u0026hellip;hindsight is a Glitch\u0026quot; :). Sometimes you can\u0026rsquo;t just hack an MVP together; you need a fully polished product. But I don\u0026rsquo;t think that\u0026rsquo;s the case here.\nIt seems to me they put too much effort on having a full product, and lost sight of the bigger picture. They repeated some of the same fatal mistakes others have done. For example, Lessons from Habitat outlines many of the same pitfalls, as seen by the creators of Lucasfilm in the mid-80\u0026rsquo;s. The entire paper is a great read, but one part that strikes me as relevant to this discussion:\n\u0026ldquo;While we find much of the work presently being done on elaborate interface technologies \u0026ndash; DataGloves, head-mounted displays, special-purpose rendering engines, and so on \u0026ndash; both exciting and promising, the almost mystical euphoria that currently seems to surround all this hardware is, in our opinion, both excessive and somewhat misplaced.\nWe can\u0026rsquo;t help having a nagging sense that it\u0026rsquo;s all a bit of a distraction from the really pressing issues.\n*At the core of our vision is the idea that cyberspace is necessarily a multiple-participant environment. It seems to us that the things that are important to the inhabitants of such an environment are the capabilities available to them, the characteristics of the other people they encounter there, and the ways these various participants can affect one another.\nBeyond a foundation set of communications capabilities, the details of the technology used to present this environment to its participants, while sexy and interesting, are of relatively peripheral concern.\u0026rdquo;\nKeep in mind the first Habitat was launched in 1986, almost 30 years ago, and ran in 64Kb on a Commodore64.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re now spoiled by Call Of Duty and hyper-realist NBA games. But there\u0026rsquo;s a point to be made that the success of an MMO game is not defined by its level of peripheral sophistication (be it design, cuteness, or head-mounted displays), but by the social experience, and how people interact with each other. Minecraft, with its blocky graphics and limited interactivity, is a prime example.\nGlitch isn\u0026rsquo;t alone in repeating these mistakes. Worlds Chat did the same two decades ago, being the first 3D world ever created. It was later replaced by The Palace. Later Philip Rosedale had his chance with Second Life, which exploded, then burst, and now is becoming cool again (and Philip is trying his hand again with High Fidelity).\nAnother issue with Glitch was its channel distribution. It\u0026rsquo;s challenging in 2012 to succeed with a web-only game, especially if you\u0026rsquo;re not anchored on Facebook. And Glitch was built in Flash (!), so it missed billions of 2-3 minutes slots of free time that people have when waiting for the train, bathroom, elevator.

Sony. HBGary Hack. FBI. Paypal, Visa \u0026amp; MasterCard. Mubarak. Occupy Wall Street. SOPA/PIPA.\nAnonymous has been busy for the past few years. It started as juvenile pranks on 4chan\u0026rsquo;s boards, but grew and became a powerful mechanism against oppressive governments and unscrupulous corporations.\nIts trajectory was beautifully captured in the documentary \u0026ldquo;We Are Legion: The Story of the Hacktivists\u0026rdquo;, that will be released later this year. I had the pleasure to watch the premiere in Austin during SXSW, and I must say - it\u0026rsquo;s f..ing brilliant. The movie is still in post-production, so the theatrical release may be slightly different.\nWe also participated in an exclusive interview with the film director \u0026ldquo;Brian Knappenberger\u0026rdquo;, who was joined on stage by former Anonymous member Gregg Housh and two special guests Anon behind masks: one from Austin, and another just called Anonymous9000, connecting via Skype from an undisclosed location (and using a robotic voice changer). It was a surreal experience.\nTogether they gave a passionate and fascinating perspective of the evolution of Anonymous, its internal workings, and the journey since 4Chan to the present day. They discussed how the group went after the Church of Scientology, why they hacked HBGary, discussed the release of confidential data of Sony customers, and how lately they\u0026rsquo;ve started to engage in social movements around freedom, Occupy Wall Street, the Arab Spring, and the support to Wikileaks\u0026rsquo; founder, Julian Assange.\nA few highlights of the session, in no particular order:\nsome Anons don\u0026rsquo;t agree with the dump of personal information (like in Sony\u0026rsquo;s case). But a few radical sub-groups - like Lulzsec - have a different opinion, and believe the press only pays attention when something concrete happens. Ironically, one of the most vocal supporters of dumping personal data was Sabu - which was revealed last week to be an FBI informant since June 2011. Conflict of interest, maybe?\nAnons in general don\u0026rsquo;t support attacking the press, as they believe in freedom of expression themselves (even when it is press against Anonymous). Some may disagree. Others simply don\u0026rsquo;t care; they\u0026rsquo;re in for the lulz, and accuse others of being moralfags. It\u0026rsquo;s these constant disagreements within Anonymous\u0026rsquo; anarchic structure that gave birth to dissidents, like Lulzsec.\n\u0026ldquo;Thousands of twenty-something socially awkward nerds got laid for the first time due to these movements and events in real life. Behind a mask, they all felt more comfortable in expressing themselves and talking with girls. We saw several marriages between Anons that met while protesting against the Church of Scientology and others\u0026rdquo;.\n\u0026ldquo;The DDoS attacks have just one objective: attract press. Whenever we have a message that we want the press to distribute, we DDoS someone so the press will publish the news that Anonymous attacked again, followed by what we wanted them to communicate. Otherwise we\u0026rsquo;d be just ignored. Look at SOPA/PIPA; we\u0026rsquo;ve been talking about this for years, and no one ever cared. Then we DDoS\u0026rsquo;d RIAA/MPAA/DoJ websites\u0026hellip; and the press showed up in full force overnight.\u0026rdquo;\nWatch the trailer here [YouTube].\nUpdate 2012-11-17: now also available for rental on Vimeo. This is the first time that Vimeo does movie rental. EDIT: Vimeo link is broken, but as of May 2025 it is now available on YouTube.\nUpdate 2012-10-17: it is opening in theatres this weekend. NY, LA, Houston, Canada, Rio de Janeiro and others. Check to see if your city is in the list. You can also pre-order the movie, starting on 10/30.

If you\u0026rsquo;re not one of the 12,000 people already using the service (that\u0026rsquo;s the number Andrea gave during the talk), well\u0026hellip; you should give it a try, because everyone is talking about it. Yeah, I live in the echo chamber, I know.\nGlancee, like its competitors Highlight, Sonar, Banjo, are all exploring the new niche of location social discovery - some sort of Match.com-meets-LinkedIn. Unproven territory, but sounds promising (albeit somewhat dystopian) to me. Andrea spoke about the current status of social discovery apps and the different approaches taken by each player. He also mentioned the incredible growth (hard to see 12,000 as incredible, but startup founders have to drink their own Kool-Aid), particularly with all the buzz around SXSW.\nBut to me the most interesting tidbit was the concept of monetizing the service via Spatial Analysis.\nHe didn\u0026rsquo;t elaborate much, so let me speculate a bit here. Consider that you have a device on your pocket that is connected to Facebook (i.e. knows everything about your attitudinal behavior - including Likes, affinity with brands, reach, friends). You have Glancee installed, and as such it is constantly broadcasting your current geolocation. Every. Single. Minute. Like Google Latitude, but with a Facebook social layer on top of it.\nNot only it knows who you are and what you like, but also where you\u0026rsquo;ve been, where you work, live, play, study, shop, your the preferred gas station, and countries you\u0026rsquo;ve travelled.\nAll this leads to a level of geospatial analysis never seen before, using all your social graph as an extra dimension. You could plot heatmaps showing location of people that liked your brand on FB, and use to optimize out-of-home media placement. Or monitor the consumers of a competitor brand when planning new physical stores. Basically it\u0026rsquo;s any marketer\u0026rsquo;s dream come true.\nOf course, it has just one small problem: it needs permission, and critical mass. You need tens of millions of users using the service, in order to have a meaningful representation.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why Andreas was so adamant when I asked him about his number one goal: \u0026ldquo;Growth. And fast\u0026rdquo;.\nUpdate 2012-05-04: it seems Facebook may agree with me here \u0026ndash; Facebook just announced they\u0026rsquo;re acquiring Glancee. I guess Andrea can scratch off \u0026ldquo;Growth\u0026rdquo; from his list.\n","permalink":"https://wrgms.com/glancee/","summary":"\u003ccenter\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Glancee at SXSW\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/content/images/2014/Feb/glancee.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/center\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy last session of SXSW Day 2 was with \u003ca href=\"http://andreavaccari.com/\"\u003eAndrea Vaccari\u003c/a\u003e, the CEO of the trendy location-based discovery startup \u003ca href=\"http://www.glancee.com/\"\u003eGlancee\u003c/a\u003e.

But despite recent progress with Content Network and YouTube, the marketing community still see the search giant as a way to drive conversion at the bottom of the funnel. In order to move to the next level, Google has to prove they can create emotional connections with consumers.\nEnter Project Re:Brief, just announced during SXSW.\nAccording to Aman Govil, Google\u0026rsquo;s Product Marketing Manager, the idea was to \u0026ldquo;re-imagine iconic campaigns of 4 classic global brands through the lenses of modern technology\u0026rdquo;. The project aims to be a benchmark of what is possible when you have the right idea and the perfect balance between creativity \u0026amp; technology.\nThe brands were carefully selected: Coca-Cola with Hilltop, Volvo with Drive it like you hate it, Avis We try harder, and Alka-Seltzer I can\u0026rsquo;t believe I ate the whole thing. The secret sauce was that they brought back from retirement the original creators of these 4 campaigns, and paired them with digital creatives, so they could re-imagine their original creations, leveraging today\u0026rsquo;s technology.\nIt was fascinating to see people like Harvey Gabor (Coca-Cola\u0026rsquo;s Hilltop, 1971) working with a bunch of twenty-something, and discovering how to use touch screens, mobile, realtime web.\nI had the opportunity to chat with Aman and Drew (the global creative director for the new campaigns) to understand how they pulled it together. Surprisingly, each project took just 2-3 months, and were executed with a relatively small budget (\u0026ldquo;Less than a TV spots\u0026rdquo;, told me Drew). Seems the advertisers were initially resistant to touch iconic pieces like Hilltop, but eventually understood the spirit of the project, and loved the opportunity to work with the original creators.\nWhat is even more fascinating is that not a single can of Coke or Alka-Seltzer was sold because this initiative. Google pulled this off not to help their clients sell more, but to help themseves. The target audience was marketers and agencies, hoping they would talk, comment, write blog posts. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t get more meta than this.\nCheck out more at www.projectrebrief.com, and look for the documentary later this year.\nUpdate 2012-06-22: the full documentary is now available on YouTube.\n","permalink":"https://wrgms.com/rebrief/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/content/images/2014/Feb/google_rebrief-1.png\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the past years Google has been trying to go beyond search, diversifying their revenue sources.

It took me some time to make it work like I wanted (keyboard, extensions, application menu, etc), but I\u0026rsquo;m quite happy with everything. Or almost everything.\nOne thing I enjoyed over the years was the ability to customize my keyboard shortcuts. I have dozens of shotcuts - to center windows on my screen, to open programs, start and stop Spotify, to run macros, to log in to my remote servers, and so on.\nOne of my handy shortcuts is \u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;F1\u0026gt; to open an xterm with superuser, and \u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;F2\u0026gt; for regular user. I use custom xterm profiles, so I can easily check if I\u0026rsquo;m running under a privileged context by looking at the color of the window.\nThis worked well for years under Ubuntu 14.04 and Gnome 3.20, but stopped working with the upgrade to Bionic Beaver. More specifically, \u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;F1\u0026gt; is now System Help, with no way to change it.\n\u0026ldquo;No problem\u0026rdquo;, I thought; this can be easily adjusted in System Settings.\nNops.\nI searched around, and found other folks with the same problem, but no solution.\nI then decided to dug into the source code, and discovered the improbable: Gnome devs decided the help was so important that it deserved its own unique, hardcoded, and immutable shortcut. If you want to reassign it, you\u0026rsquo;re out of luck.\nAccording to gnome-settings-daemon changelog:\n=============== Version 3.21.90 =============== ... Media keys: - Add Super+F1 as a hardcoded shortcut for launching Help ... REALLY? What\u0026rsquo;s wrong with a default icon in the toolbar, or maybe a popup window when you boot for the first time? Also, does anyone really care about reading the basic documentation for\u0026hellip; a windows manager?\nI wasn\u0026rsquo;t convinced yet, but a closer look at the source code confirmed my fear: there it was: (file /gnome-settings-daemon/blob/master/plugins/media-keys/shortcuts-list.h):\n{ HELP_KEY, NULL, N_(\u0026#34;Help\u0026#34;), \u0026#34;\u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;F1\u0026#34;, GSD_ACTION_MODE_LAUNCHER }, So if you\u0026rsquo;re really determined to regain control of your \u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;F1\u0026gt;, there\u0026rsquo;s only one solution: to recompile gnome-settings-daemon, and replace the gsd-media-keys plugin. Spoiler alert: I\u0026rsquo;m glad to report that my patch was successful, but beware: getting the right dependencies and recompiling Gnome is not an easy feat. Keep reading if you\u0026rsquo;re interested in doing the same:\nDownload and install Gnome Builder Click on \u0026ldquo;Clone\u0026rdquo;, select a local directory (e.g., ~/Projects/) and use the official repo at https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-settings-daemon Open xterm, and enter cd ~/Projects/gnome-settings-daemon; git checkout tags/GNOME_SETTINGS_DAEMON_3_28_1 (you can check your exact version with gnome-shell --version. Check all tags available with git tag -l) Install all dependencies. These were the ones missing in my system, but YMMV: apt install libcolord-dev \\ libgeocode-glib-dev \\ gnome-desktop3-data \\ libgnome-desktop-3-dev \\ libgweather-3-dev \\ libcanberra-gtk3-dev \\ libgeoclue-2-dev \\ libnotify-dev \\ libpulse-mainloop-glib0 \\ libpulse-dev \\ gobject-introspection \\ libupower-glib-dev \\ libpolkit-gobject-1-dev \\ libasound2-dev \\ libgudev-1.0-dev \\ libwacom-dev \\ libnss3-dev \\ libcups2-dev \\ libnm-dev Patch the source code by editing ~/Projects/gnome-settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/shortcuts-list.h, and add a comment in front of the offender, like below (for Gnome 3.28.1 it is in line 69): // disabled! // { HELP_KEY, NULL, N_(\u0026#34;Help\u0026#34;), \u0026#34;\u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;F1\u0026#34;, GSD_ACTION_MODE_LAUNCHER }, Click [Rebuild] button in the Builder UI to compile (note: you need to click Rebuild, and not Build). You may want to turn off the deprecation warnings by editing meson.build and adding '-Wno-deprecated-declarations' to test_cflags = [...]; (line 70). If you installed all the dependencies correctly, you should have no warnings nor errors. Find the compiled binaries. You\u0026rsquo;re looking specifically for the plugin gsd-media-keys, so it\u0026rsquo;ll likely be in the directory ~/.var/app/org.gnome.Builder/cache/gnome-builder/projects/gnome-settings-daemon/builds/default-host-HEAD/plugins/media-keys cd ~/.var/app/org.gnome.Builder/cache/gnome-builder/projects/gnome-settings-daemon/builds/default-host-HEAD/plugins/media-keys ~ cp ./gsd-media-keys ~/gsd-media-keys.patched Before proceeding, you may want to inspect your binary to confirm it successfully linked with shared libraries by using ldd ~/gsd-media-keys.patched. In my case I had problems finding libgsd.so, so I solved it by adding the path to ldconfig (although the correct solution would be to fix this in the build system): sudo sh -c \u0026#39;echo \u0026#34;# gnome-settings-daemon\\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gnome-settings-daemon-3.0/\\n\u0026#34; \u0026gt; /etc/ld.so.conf.d/gnome-settings-daemon.conf\u0026#39; sudo ldconfig You\u0026rsquo;re now ready to install the patched gsd-media-keys binary in your system: cd /usr/lib/gnome-settings-daemon/ sudo mv ~/gsd-media-keys.patched . sudo strip -s ./gsd-media-keys.patched sudo mv gsd-media-keys gsd-media-keys.orig sudo ln -s gsd-media-keys.patched gsd-media-keys Log out or reboot, and you\u0026rsquo;re done! If all goes well, your system now should be running the gsd-media-keys plugin without the \u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;F1\u0026gt; hardcoded, so you can reassign to anything you like.\nIf anything goes wrong and you can\u0026rsquo;t log in, don\u0026rsquo;t despair. Simply open a console terminal by using \u0026lt;Ctrl\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;Alt\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;F2\u0026gt; and restore your original gsd-media-keys binary by doing:\ncd /usr/lib/gnome-settings-daemon/ sudo rm gsd-media-keys sudo ln -s gsd-media-keys.orig gsd-media-keys Use \u0026lt;Ctrl\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;Alt\u0026gt;\u0026lt;F1\u0026gt; to go back to Gnome and log in again. You can then inspect /var/log/syslog to understand what went wrong (search for \u0026ldquo;media-keys\u0026rdquo;). It\u0026rsquo;s likely that you had problems with the dynamic libraries in step 8 above.\n","permalink":"https://wrgms.com/fixing-gnome-3-2x-hardcoded-superf1-shortcut/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eUbuntu 18.04 LTS is finally out, and with it you now have Gnome out of the box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve been using Gnome for several years, and have enjoyed its minimalism.

You may smile. But it will come…” [Henry Ford, 1940]\nFlying cars are not something new. The idea has been going around since the 19th century, even before the very first flight by Santos-Dumont (or Wright Brothers, depending on your bias). But it was The Jetsons who first brought the concept of flying cars to the masses. We grew up dreaming that one day we\u0026rsquo;d be able to get in our cars and fly straight to our destination - fast, safely, and traffic-free.\nThanks to Moore\u0026rsquo;s Law and the latest advances in engineering, we may be closer to flying cars than you think.\nAeroMobil is an innovative company from Slovakia, founded by Štefan Klein and Juraj Vaculik. Štefan, a well-known designer for Audi, Volkswagen and BMW, has been pursuing this idea for more than two decades. Juraj has a long and successful track record in advertising and as an investor. The two minds came together to create the company and make the dream a reality.\nDuring his talk at SXSW today, Juraj talked about the latest advances and their recent flying prototypes. As you can see on the two videos below, they made quite a progress between version 2.5 (early 2013) and 3.0 (late 2014).\nAeroMobil 2.5:\nAeroMobil 3.0: (note that Štefan himself test drives every prototype. He believes no one understand the machines better than him)\nDespite the progress, don\u0026rsquo;t expect to be driving - err.. flying - just yet. There are still several roadblocks (no pun intended) before mass adoption. They still need to figure out logistical challenges, like fueling stations, or grass strips next to roads for landing and take off. And change legislations, and define new testing procedures and certification. Or get people certified as pilots (yeah, don\u0026rsquo;t think your driver\u0026rsquo;s license will fly).\nBut with Google investing so heavily in self-driving cars, and SpaceX sending rockets to space, it\u0026rsquo;s not hard to imagine these efforts converging and eventually giving birth to self-driving flying cars. It might sound crazy at first, but there\u0026rsquo;s a good chance we\u0026rsquo;ll see it in our lifetime. AeroMobil may be in the exact spot that Paul Graham calls a Frighteningly Ambitious Startup Idea.\nCrazy? Yes.

With 800+ sessions this year, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to get overwhelmed. But get over your FOMO, and enjoy the serendipity. You will miss many good sessions, and that\u0026rsquo;s OK. The best talk will be that one you didn\u0026rsquo;t plan, and just entered because your first option was full.\nSpeaking of crowded sessions: always have a plan B. Your first option will likely be full, so having a second/third option is always important.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t go to panels. Ever. There\u0026rsquo;s hardly enough time for one person to convey a good idea in under 60 minutes. 4 or 5 becomes a festival of shallow sound bites. You already have Twitter for those.\nSeek geeky and obscure talks. The less buzzwords on the description, the better. Extra points if the talk is by someone who is actually making things - rather than people talking about those who made it. I saw some unbelievably good sessions in the past which had less 20 participants in the audience.\nBring an extra battery pack. Your phone will die midday, even if you have an iPhone 6 Plus. Pack some extra juice.\nPlan your commute time between sessions. Some venues are 2 miles away from Austin Convention Center, and shuttles may take 15-30 min door-to-door. Try Lyft/Uber, or pedicabs. Or you can be ultra-hipster and apply for a loaner Boosted Board. I already secured mine!\nDriving is usually a bad idea. Parking is expensive, and you may want to have a beer or two (or six or ten). Get an Uber/Lyft, or use the official shuttles, but be prepared to spend one hour each way. And remind yourself next time to book your ticket the exact minute they go on sale, and enjoy the convenience of a hotel in walking distance.\nHave a good breakfast. You won\u0026rsquo;t eat much during the day, and you\u0026rsquo;re probably still recovering from last night.\nRSVPs are usually useless. Most of the parties don\u0026rsquo;t require RSVP, and use it just to collect email addresses. And the ones that do are not the ones you see on blogs. [EDIT: this used to be true, but it\u0026rsquo;s now starting to change. Many parties are now respecting RSVPs, and even many of the talks in the official program started to require reservation, so play safe and do your homework.]\nRemember: SXSW is a marathon, not a sprint. It\u0026rsquo;s 5 full days (double if you do Music/Film), so take time to enjoy yourself. It\u0026rsquo;s Spring, and there\u0026rsquo;s no better time to be in Austin.

The requirements are:\nMust be able to listen continuously Run on embedded ARM processors (particuarly Raspberry Pi and BeagleBone Black) Good accuracy on a limited set of words (English only) Decent performance, particularly on low-power CPUs My first thought was to use Google Speech API. The accuracy is great, and it\u0026rsquo;s reasonably fast. But it is also limited to only 50 calls per day, so it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t satisfy requirement #1. And I don\u0026rsquo;t like the idea of streaming all of my personal conversations to anyone. It\u0026rsquo;s already enough to have NSA listening to my phone calls\u0026hellip;\n(maybe it\u0026rsquo;s an option for the future, when implementing something with a physical push-button, like a Star Trek communicator device)\nSiriProxy is another neat hack, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work with iOS7/8 anymore. Apple will soon offer an official interface to Siri via its HomeKit program, but it\u0026rsquo;ll only work with licensed hardware. Likely not an option for hackers and personal projects.\nAfter some research, I found CMUSphinx project, which seems to be the best project in the area of voice recognition. PocketSphinx toolkit is the version you want for embedded CPUs, as it\u0026rsquo;s pure C, and rather portable.\nThe documentation is not very friendly, but once you get it going, it works well.\nThe first step is to download and install SphinxBase, followed by PocketSphinx. The README has instructions to compile and install, but it\u0026rsquo;s the basic\n./configure make make install By default it\u0026rsquo;ll install binaries to /usr/local/bin, and language models to /usr/local/share. Make sure you have swig and alsa drivers installed before starting (apt-get install swig alsa-base alsa-utils).\nOnce installed, you need to figure out which dictionary model you want to use. Just for testing, I created a dictionary with 106 words, based on the old Logo language (remember the Logo turtle?), like forward, backward, turn right, turn left, etc.\nBefore you can start training PocketSphinx, you\u0026rsquo;ll need an acoustic model. Sadly, the speech corpus (i.e., audio files with spoken words) used to train the models are usually closed source. So either you spend a couple of hours recording the voices (or using an4/Voxforge) to train your own model, or you\u0026rsquo;ll skip this entirely and just use some of the built-in models, accepting lower accuracy. Given my limited number of words in the dictionary, I decided to go with built in acoustic models.\nNext, you need to describe your Language Model - the words, grammar, and frequency of words that you want to recognize. This tutorial has more details. If you\u0026rsquo;re in a hurry and just want to get PocketSphinx going with a dictionary for your pre-defined words, save yourself some trouble and use the online lmtool. This webservice will allow you to upload your dictionary file (a simple ASCII file, with one sentence or word per line), and it\u0026rsquo;ll generate all the language models you need to run PocketSphinx.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a sample of my dictionary file:\nannounce answer ask back clipboard color copy count ... sentence set space square root stamp wait wait until when who word If you want to play with this dictionary, download these files here, and run:\npocketsphinx_continuous -lm lm/logo.lm -dict lm/logo.dic (note: if pocketsphinx is stuck at READY, it\u0026rsquo;s probably listening to the wrong hw device. Check where is the microphone attached via cat /proc/asound/cards, and add -adcdev plughw:X,0 to the line above, replacing X by the hardware id of your microphone).\npocketsphinx_continuous -lm lm/logo.lm -dict lm/logo.dic -adcdev plughw:2,0 Smartphones use all sorts of tricks to cancel the background noise, but that requires special hardware, so you\u0026rsquo;ll need a reasonable quiet environment. Otherwise the accuracy will suffer, depending on how large your dictionary is.\nAs you would expect, smaller dictionaries have much better accuracy. With a 100-word, I got 60-70% correct. After I reduced to a simple 15-words dictionary, I got virtually 100% match rate, even with some background noise and a non-American accent. Certainly enough for my projects.\nNext up: running this on a Raspberry Pi, installing a decent openair microphone, and testing overall performance when connected to a home automation system.

It\u0026rsquo;s a shame that Linux keyboard is still horribly broken by default (some may say it\u0026rsquo;s by design; no, it\u0026rsquo;s not).\nIt has been asked before, but most answers will point you to use xim, which will open another can of worms.

Some say it\u0026rsquo;ll the the digital renaissance; others claim it\u0026rsquo;s the best thing to ever happen to the web, after the browser itself.\nThis video summarizes well the sentiment:\nThis is wrong.\nTen years from now we\u0026rsquo;ll look back and realize how much the new gTLDs have hurt us.\nFirst, most of the new gTLDs add little or no value. I bet we could live another 50 years without a .ninja, a .soy, .fail, .florist, or .loans.\nOthers will proclaim that the new gTLDs are useful, and point to domains like .nyc, .london, or .website, as examples of the \u0026ldquo;democratization\u0026rdquo; promoted by the new categories.\nBut these will be the exception rather than the rule. In practice the new gTLDS will force brands to spend millions of dollars to protect against cybersquatters rushing to claim new brand-related domains, amongst other threats.\nBefore you had to register your brand across a handful of TLDs. Now you have 1,400 more to worry about. That\u0026rsquo;s like a whack-a-mole game, but you\u0026rsquo;re outnumbered by hundreds of moles for each hand you have.\nAnd yet, this is not my main concern. Brands got screwed and will spend a ton of money, while domain registrars will be laughing all the way to the bank. Whatever, life will be fine.\nMy concern is a different one: the new gTLDs will accelerate the demise of the URI.\nWe already lost users to search. It\u0026rsquo;s more convenient to type \u0026ldquo;Brand\u0026rdquo; on the browser and let your search engine do the rest than typing \u0026ldquo;brand.com\u0026rdquo;. And on mobile the URL is already hidden from the user, as if it were an irrelevant technical implementation detail. Same on Safari on desktop.\nBut now multiply this situation by thousands of gTLDs, and you\u0026rsquo;ll have the perfect Paradox of Choice. Is it a .com, a .net, .cc? Nops. Keep going friend.\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s add to the mix the fact that a) most of the mobile traffic is already coming from native apps, and b) Apple is pushing to bury the URI, and c) Google is replacing everything by its omni-search. And we\u0026rsquo;re not even talking about Siri or voice-activated search. This will result in a very different world. My prediction: thanks to the new gTLDs, mobile apps and commercial players will have even more control than today, and URLs will be demoted to second-class citizens. They will still be there, but buried somewhere in the sub-menus of your browser, or the API of your Chrome extensions. Just like IP addresses; you know it\u0026rsquo;s there somewhere, but nobody cares.\nIn the name of find-ability and ease of use, we\u0026rsquo;ll live in an URL-less world. And commercial entities will be rewarded and profit from your traffic.\nI\u0026rsquo;m sure that\u0026rsquo;s not the web that Sir Tim Berners-Lee envisioned 25 years ago.\n","permalink":"https://wrgms.com/gtlds-and-the-death-of-urls/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eUnless you\u0026rsquo;ve been living under a rock, you\u0026rsquo;ve read \u003cem\u003ead nauseum\u003c/em\u003e about the overly optimistic predictions for the new gTLDs.

Wrong.\nBut this time I was the one to blame.\nAfter solving the conflict with bash, I changed /etc/passwd user shell to /bin/bash. The only problem is that Synology wipes the system partition during firmware upgrades, so when I upgraded to DSM 4.1.2668, my custom `/bin/bash``was gone. Of course this locked me out of the system. No SSH, SCP or FTP. Great.\nAfter a few moments of panic, I remembered I still had the serial console. So I could put Linux in single user mode, and drop into recovery mode.\nSo if you\u0026rsquo;re ever in a similar situation, here\u0026rsquo;s how to fix it:\n1. First, you need a serial console.\n2. During U-Boot, press any key to cancel the automatic kernel boot (Hit any key to stop autoboot).\n3. Enter printenv to check the environment variables. Search for bootargs and bootm variables (they will be different on your system, so do NOT copy and paste from mine, unless you have a Synology DS212+ with the same DSM).\n4. Append reboot=cold,hard emergency init=/bin/sh to the end of bootargs variable. In my case, this is what I used:\nsetenv bootargs \u0026#39;console=ttyS0,115200 ip=off initrd=0x00800040,4M root=/dev/md0 rw syno_hw_version=DS212pv20 ihd_num=2 netif_num=1 esata_7042=1 reboot=cold,hard emergency init=/bin/sh\u0026#39; (again, your parameters will likely be different, so don\u0026rsquo;t copy and paste)\n5. Boot your kernel, with\nbootm F8080000 F8280000 Now your Synology should be happily botting in single user mode, ignoring /etc/passwd and dropping you to a plain shell. Do what you have to do to fix the system, and reboot.\nYou can also use these steps to recover your system partition from a crash or other problem.\n","permalink":"https://wrgms.com/entering-single-user-mode-on-a-synology/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"alt text\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/content/images/2013/01/synology.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hope this will be my last post about Synology for a while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter dealing for a few weeks with an \u003ca href=\"http://forum.synology.com/enu/viewtopic.php?f=221\u0026amp;t=59808\u0026amp;start=45#p232455\"\u003eunstable environment\u003c/a\u003e, then \u003ca href=\"/recovering-a-failed-synology-diskstation-ds2xx-serial\"\u003ehacking a serial console\u003c/a\u003e to troubleshoot, then \u003ca href=\"/synologys-secret-telnet-password/\"\u003ecracking the secret recovery telnet password\u003c/a\u003e just for fun, and finally solving the \u003ca href=\"http://serverfault.com/questions/458553/cant-log-in-via-ssh-to-any-accounts-set-to-use-bin-bash-as-a-default-shell/\"\u003eweird mistery\u003c/a\u003e of SSH \u003ca href=\"/reverse-engineering-synology-openssh\"\u003enot accepting /bin/bash as default shell\u003c/a\u003e, I thought I finally had a stable environment.

The user has to be called \u0026ldquo;root\u0026rdquo;.\nWHAAAT?\nThankfully, Synology uses a modified Linux distribution, so they publish the code under GPL.\nAfter a couple of hours looking at the OpenSSH source code, things became pretty obvious. Here\u0026rsquo;s the piece of code from their version of OpenSSH 5.8p1, file session.c:\nvoid do_child(Session *s, const char *command) { ... #ifdef MY_ABC_HERE char szValue[8]; int RunSSH = 0; SSH_CMD SSHCmd = REQ_UNKNOWN; if (1 == GetKeyValue(\u0026#34;/etc/synoinfo.conf\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;runssh\u0026#34;, szValue, sizeof(szValue))) { if (strcasecmp(szValue, \u0026#34;yes\u0026#34;) == 0) { RunSSH = 1; } } if (IsSFTPReq(command)){ SSHCmd = REQ_SFTP; } else if (IsRsyncReq(command)){ SSHCmd = REQ_RSYNC; } else if (IsTimebkpRequest(command)){ SSHCmd = REQ_TIMEBKP; } else if (RunSSH \u0026amp;amp;\u0026amp;amp; IsAllowShell(pw)){ SSHCmd = REQ_SHELL; } else { goto Err; } if (REQ_RSYNC == SSHCmd) { pw = SYNOChgValForRsync(pw); } if (!SSHCanLogin(SSHCmd, pw)) { goto Err; } goto Pass; Err: fprintf(stderr, \u0026#34;Permission denied, please try again.\\n\u0026#34;); exit(1); Pass: #endif /* MY_ABC_HERE */ ... } And here is the IsAllowShell(pw):\nstatic int IsAllowShell(const struct passwd *pw) { struct passwd *pUnPrivilege = NULL; char *szUserName = NULL; if (!pw || !pw-\u0026amp;gt;pw_name) { return 0; } szUserName = pw-\u0026amp;gt;pw_name; if(!strcmp(szUserName, \u0026#34;root\u0026#34;) || !strcmp(szUserName, \u0026#34;admin\u0026#34;)){ return 1; } if (NULL != (pUnPrivilege = getpwnam(szUserName))){ if (!strcmp(pUnPrivilege-\u0026amp;gt;pw_shell, \u0026#34;/bin/sh\u0026#34;) || !strcmp(pUnPrivilege-\u0026amp;gt;pw_shell, \u0026#34;/bin/ash\u0026#34;)) { return 1; } } return 0; } Basically synology created a heavily customized version of OpenSSH, including a handful of hacks - e.g., additional checking before accepting a login to see if the SSH service is enabled within the web interface, or stripping special chars (;, |, \u0026lsquo;) from rsync commands, and\u0026hellip; wait for it\u0026hellip; blocking anyone other than root or admin from using any shell other than /bin/sh or /bin/ash.\nOnce identified the cause, the fix was easy: just remove the call to IsAllowShell(). Cross-compile, upload to the NAS, reboot and voilà, regular users can now use bash normally.\nThe hardest part was to get cross-compiling working properly.

Or you simply don\u0026rsquo;t like the idea of having your port 23 open to the world for god-knows-how-long until a Synology tech support can look into your case.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ve probably tried telneting to your NAS. Maybe you\u0026rsquo;ve even tried opening the case and hacking the serial port, only to discover that you don\u0026rsquo;t have the root password. The DS Assistant password doesn\u0026rsquo;t work, and you exhausted all obvious guesses - blank, synopass, synology, password, admin, root, etc.\nWell, what about c12-0804? No, I didn\u0026rsquo;t make this up. This is today\u0026rsquo;s password.\nBut if you\u0026rsquo;re reading this a few days (or years) from now, too bad; it won\u0026rsquo;t work. Unless, of course, you wait until December 8th. Because the password repeats every year.\nBasically Synology hardcoded a modified login binary within the firmware that accepts an obfuscated password for root, which depends on the current date. (by the way, this isn\u0026rsquo;t the only thing Synology folks hardcoded in the firmware).\nThanks to GPL, Synology was forced to publish the original source code for the firmware. Based on the original correct_password.c code, I hacked a short snippet to generate the daily password.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the Synology Telnet password generator:\n#include \u0026amp;lt;stdlib.h\u0026amp;gt; #include \u0026amp;lt;time.h\u0026amp;gt; #include \u0026amp;lt;stdio.h\u0026amp;gt; void main() { struct timeval tvTime; struct tm tmOutput; gettimeofday(\u0026amp;amp;tvTime, 0); localtime_r(\u0026amp;amp;(tvTime.tv_sec), \u0026amp;amp;tmOutput); tmOutput.tm_mon += 1; printf(\u0026#34;password for today is: %x%02d-%02x%02d\\n\\n\u0026#34;, tmOutput.tm_mon, tmOutput.tm_mon, tmOutput.tm_mday, gcd(tmOutput.tm_mon, tmOutput.tm_mday)); } int gcd(int a, int b) { return (b?gcd(b,a%b):a); } Compile and run the code above with gcc. You can also use the excellent Codepad Repl.it to run the code online and get the password for today (no registration needed).\nBonus tip: if you\u0026rsquo;re curious how exactly the password is generated, here\u0026rsquo;s the algorithm:\n1st character = month in hexadecimal, lower case (1=Jan, \u0026hellip; , a=Oct, b=Nov, c=Dec) 2-3 = month in decimal, zero padded and starting in 1 (01, 02, 03, \u0026hellip;, 11, 12) 4 = dash 5-6 = day of the month in hex (01, 02 .., 0A, .., 1F) 7-8 = greatest common divisor between month and day, zero padded. This is always a number between 01 and 12. So, let\u0026rsquo;s say today is October 15, the password would be: a10-0f05 where a = month in hex, 10 = month in decimal, 0f = day in hex, 05 = greatest divisor between 10 and 15).\nIf you have trouble calculating the greatest common divisor (elementary math, anyone?), Wolfram Alpha is your friend.\nThis was tested on a Synology DS212+, with Marvell Kirkwood mv6282 chipset. It\u0026rsquo;s unlikely but still possible that different models use a different algorithm. YMMV, so always check the source code.\n[UPDATE 1: Several users reported that this works in many other models, including DS409, DS112j, etc. Please leave a comment with your model and firmware version.]\n[UPDATE 2: If it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work, it\u0026rsquo;s probably that your date is incorrect in the NAS. Per Patrick\u0026rsquo;s suggestion in the comments below, try \u0026ldquo;101-0101\u0026rdquo;, which is the password for Jan 01]\n","permalink":"https://wrgms.com/synologys-secret-telnet-password/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIf you have a Synology NAS and had some sort of disk crash in the past, you\u0026rsquo;ve probably encountered the famous \u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;Cannot format system partition\u0026rdquo;\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;Please configure your router to forward port 23 to DiskStation and contact Synology online support\u0026rdquo;\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, it sucks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt sucks even more when you know the disk is perfectly fine, and you still have hopes to recover your data.

The software is robust and much better than my old DroboFS, and the fact that it is entirely open source is a big plus.\nI recently upgraded the firmware to DSM 2661. Everything worked fine. For 12 hours. The next morning, the device was dead, with the blue blink of death).\nWas it the new firmware? Or maybe a disk crash? Who knows.\nI followed the basic tests recommended by Synology: remove both disks, turn it on and wait 30s for a long beep. Beeeeeep. Great, the motherboard is still functional. It also responded to ping and showed up on DS Assistant, so processor and ethernet are also working fine.\nThe Synology DS NAS is basically an embedded Linux box, using md + lvm for RAID. Nothing is proprietary, so I mounted the disks on my Linux desktop and spent a few more hours cloning and re-building the RAID using a spare disk. Life is good.\nTill\u0026hellip; it crashed again.\nThere was something wrong with the system partition, so I wanted to see inside the NAS, before the kernel finishes booting.\nThankfully, Synology folks already put a physical serial port in there. It\u0026rsquo;s not documented, but it\u0026rsquo;s not hard to find. You just have to open the case.\nDisclaimer: make sure you have backup! I am not responsible if you lose your data, void your warranty, burn down your house or kill your dog.\nStart by opening the case. Here\u0026rsquo;s a video with instructions [update: the original video is not available anymore, but here\u0026rsquo;s a similar one]. Be aware this may break the small internal hooks, and you\u0026rsquo;ll need to use tape or hot glue to put it back together (what\u0026rsquo;s wrong with manufacturers these days? What\u0026rsquo;s the problem with good old screws?) Inside the case, look for a 6-pin header, normally labeled JP2 (or COM1 on older models). The pins likely are: Pin Number Function Confirmed on Synology DS212+ \u0026nbsp; 13.3V 2GND 4TX 6RX Now connect the pins 2, 4 and 6 (respectively GNS, TX, RX) to your USB-TTL 3v3 cable (if using the FTDI cable from Adafruit, it\u0026rsquo;ll be 1-black, 5-yellow, 4-orange. Make sure you don\u0026rsquo;t short-circuit any of the pins. These male-female jumper wires could be useful. Open your preferred terminal program (under Win ExtraPutty is the best in town), set to 115200, disable xon/xoff, and you\u0026rsquo;re all set. Now you can turn on your DS, and see all the beauty of what\u0026rsquo;s going on under the hood:\n__ __ _ _ | \\/ | __ _ _ ____ _____| | | | |\\/| |/ _` | \u0026#39;__\\ \\ / / _ \\ | | | | | | (_| | | \\ V / __/ | | |_| |_|\\__,_|_| \\_/ \\___|_|_| _ _ ____ _ | | | | | __ ) ___ ___ | |_ | | | |___| _ \\ / _ \\ / _ \\| __| | |_| |___| |_) | (_) | (_) | |_ \\___/ |____/ \\___/ \\___/ \\__| ** LOADER ** ** MARVELL BOARD: Synology Disk Station LE U-Boot 1.1.4 (Dec 2 2011 - 15:56:02) Marvell version: 3.5.9 U-Boot code: 00600000 -\u0026amp;gt; 0067FFF0 BSS: -\u0026amp;gt; 0068B3D4 Soc: 88F6282 A1CPU running @ 2000Mhz L2 running @ 500Mhz SysClock = 500Mhz , TClock = 200Mhz DRAM (DDR3) CAS Latency = 7 tRP = 7 tRAS = 20 tRCD=7 DRAM CS[0] base 0x00000000 size 256MB DRAM CS[1] base 0x10000000 size 256MB DRAM Total size 512MB 16bit width Addresses 8M - 0M are saved for the U-Boot usage.

It\u0026rsquo;s sad to see so much work and love going nowhere. At least they were classy and wrote a candid and honest shutting-down post, and they\u0026rsquo;re even refunding users (!). That\u0026rsquo;s a level of integrity that you don\u0026rsquo;t see everyday in the startup world.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;ve never played Glitch, it\u0026rsquo;s now too late. The game world is now restricted to existing users, and everything will shut down on December 9th 2012. Here\u0026rsquo;s some videos to give you an idea of what you missed.\nI was part of the first wave of beta testers. Even though I\u0026rsquo;ve never spent much time playing, I remember how every detail was carefullyt thought through, and painstakenly executed. The videos don\u0026rsquo;t do justice to their attention to detail.\nBut, aside from the intrinsic beauty, the gameplay was dull. It was just a cute massive multiplayer social game. Maybe the cutest ever. But without a strong storytelling or any of the gamification tactics from other social gaming companies, there was no reason for you to keep coming back.\nIn a world of \u0026ldquo;Your crops are dying! Your friend Samantha just moved to a farm next door. Invite your friends to level up faster.\u0026rdquo;, it\u0026rsquo;s hard to keep users engaged these days.\nThis reminds me of the Steve Blank\u0026rsquo;s MVP stories. Do you need to develop a full game, with so many levels, intricate dialogues, dozens of non-playable characters, only to realize that your users aren\u0026rsquo;t coming back in the first place?\nCan\u0026rsquo;t you create a demo with a couple of levels and a handful of hard-coded NPCs, and invite your mom/sister/significant other to play? Just check how many times they come back (when you\u0026rsquo;re not looking). You\u0026rsquo;ll achieve the same conclusions, with 10% of the effort.\nOf course hindsight is a bitch \u0026ndash; or, like someone said on HN: \u0026quot;\u0026hellip;hindsight is a Glitch\u0026quot; :). Sometimes you can\u0026rsquo;t just hack an MVP together; you need a fully polished product. But I don\u0026rsquo;t think that\u0026rsquo;s the case here.\nIt seems to me they put too much effort on having a full product, and lost sight of the bigger picture. They repeated some of the same fatal mistakes others have done. For example, Lessons from Habitat outlines many of the same pitfalls, as seen by the creators of Lucasfilm in the mid-80\u0026rsquo;s. The entire paper is a great read, but one part that strikes me as relevant to this discussion:\n\u0026ldquo;While we find much of the work presently being done on elaborate interface technologies \u0026ndash; DataGloves, head-mounted displays, special-purpose rendering engines, and so on \u0026ndash; both exciting and promising, the almost mystical euphoria that currently seems to surround all this hardware is, in our opinion, both excessive and somewhat misplaced.\nWe can\u0026rsquo;t help having a nagging sense that it\u0026rsquo;s all a bit of a distraction from the really pressing issues.\n*At the core of our vision is the idea that cyberspace is necessarily a multiple-participant environment. It seems to us that the things that are important to the inhabitants of such an environment are the capabilities available to them, the characteristics of the other people they encounter there, and the ways these various participants can affect one another.\nBeyond a foundation set of communications capabilities, the details of the technology used to present this environment to its participants, while sexy and interesting, are of relatively peripheral concern.\u0026rdquo;\nKeep in mind the first Habitat was launched in 1986, almost 30 years ago, and ran in 64Kb on a Commodore64.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re now spoiled by Call Of Duty and hyper-realist NBA games. But there\u0026rsquo;s a point to be made that the success of an MMO game is not defined by its level of peripheral sophistication (be it design, cuteness, or head-mounted displays), but by the social experience, and how people interact with each other. Minecraft, with its blocky graphics and limited interactivity, is a prime example.\nGlitch isn\u0026rsquo;t alone in repeating these mistakes. Worlds Chat did the same two decades ago, being the first 3D world ever created. It was later replaced by The Palace. Later Philip Rosedale had his chance with Second Life, which exploded, then burst, and now is becoming cool again (and Philip is trying his hand again with High Fidelity).\nAnother issue with Glitch was its channel distribution. It\u0026rsquo;s challenging in 2012 to succeed with a web-only game, especially if you\u0026rsquo;re not anchored on Facebook. And Glitch was built in Flash (!), so it missed billions of 2-3 minutes slots of free time that people have when waiting for the train, bathroom, elevator.

Sony. HBGary Hack. FBI. Paypal, Visa \u0026amp; MasterCard. Mubarak. Occupy Wall Street. SOPA/PIPA.\nAnonymous has been busy for the past few years. It started as juvenile pranks on 4chan\u0026rsquo;s boards, but grew and became a powerful mechanism against oppressive governments and unscrupulous corporations.\nIts trajectory was beautifully captured in the documentary \u0026ldquo;We Are Legion: The Story of the Hacktivists\u0026rdquo;, that will be released later this year. I had the pleasure to watch the premiere in Austin during SXSW, and I must say - it\u0026rsquo;s f..ing brilliant. The movie is still in post-production, so the theatrical release may be slightly different.\nWe also participated in an exclusive interview with the film director \u0026ldquo;Brian Knappenberger\u0026rdquo;, who was joined on stage by former Anonymous member Gregg Housh and two special guests Anon behind masks: one from Austin, and another just called Anonymous9000, connecting via Skype from an undisclosed location (and using a robotic voice changer). It was a surreal experience.\nTogether they gave a passionate and fascinating perspective of the evolution of Anonymous, its internal workings, and the journey since 4Chan to the present day. They discussed how the group went after the Church of Scientology, why they hacked HBGary, discussed the release of confidential data of Sony customers, and how lately they\u0026rsquo;ve started to engage in social movements around freedom, Occupy Wall Street, the Arab Spring, and the support to Wikileaks\u0026rsquo; founder, Julian Assange.\nA few highlights of the session, in no particular order:\nsome Anons don\u0026rsquo;t agree with the dump of personal information (like in Sony\u0026rsquo;s case). But a few radical sub-groups - like Lulzsec - have a different opinion, and believe the press only pays attention when something concrete happens. Ironically, one of the most vocal supporters of dumping personal data was Sabu - which was revealed last week to be an FBI informant since June 2011. Conflict of interest, maybe?\nAnons in general don\u0026rsquo;t support attacking the press, as they believe in freedom of expression themselves (even when it is press against Anonymous). Some may disagree. Others simply don\u0026rsquo;t care; they\u0026rsquo;re in for the lulz, and accuse others of being moralfags. It\u0026rsquo;s these constant disagreements within Anonymous\u0026rsquo; anarchic structure that gave birth to dissidents, like Lulzsec.\n\u0026ldquo;Thousands of twenty-something socially awkward nerds got laid for the first time due to these movements and events in real life. Behind a mask, they all felt more comfortable in expressing themselves and talking with girls. We saw several marriages between Anons that met while protesting against the Church of Scientology and others\u0026rdquo;.\n\u0026ldquo;The DDoS attacks have just one objective: attract press. Whenever we have a message that we want the press to distribute, we DDoS someone so the press will publish the news that Anonymous attacked again, followed by what we wanted them to communicate. Otherwise we\u0026rsquo;d be just ignored. Look at SOPA/PIPA; we\u0026rsquo;ve been talking about this for years, and no one ever cared. Then we DDoS\u0026rsquo;d RIAA/MPAA/DoJ websites\u0026hellip; and the press showed up in full force overnight.\u0026rdquo;\nWatch the trailer here [YouTube].\nUpdate 2012-11-17: now also available for rental on Vimeo. This is the first time that Vimeo does movie rental. EDIT: Vimeo link is broken, but as of May 2025 it is now available on YouTube.\nUpdate 2012-10-17: it is opening in theatres this weekend. NY, LA, Houston, Canada, Rio de Janeiro and others. Check to see if your city is in the list. You can also pre-order the movie, starting on 10/30.

If you\u0026rsquo;re not one of the 12,000 people already using the service (that\u0026rsquo;s the number Andrea gave during the talk), well\u0026hellip; you should give it a try, because everyone is talking about it. Yeah, I live in the echo chamber, I know.\nGlancee, like its competitors Highlight, Sonar, Banjo, are all exploring the new niche of location social discovery - some sort of Match.com-meets-LinkedIn. Unproven territory, but sounds promising (albeit somewhat dystopian) to me. Andrea spoke about the current status of social discovery apps and the different approaches taken by each player. He also mentioned the incredible growth (hard to see 12,000 as incredible, but startup founders have to drink their own Kool-Aid), particularly with all the buzz around SXSW.\nBut to me the most interesting tidbit was the concept of monetizing the service via Spatial Analysis.\nHe didn\u0026rsquo;t elaborate much, so let me speculate a bit here. Consider that you have a device on your pocket that is connected to Facebook (i.e. knows everything about your attitudinal behavior - including Likes, affinity with brands, reach, friends). You have Glancee installed, and as such it is constantly broadcasting your current geolocation. Every. Single. Minute. Like Google Latitude, but with a Facebook social layer on top of it.\nNot only it knows who you are and what you like, but also where you\u0026rsquo;ve been, where you work, live, play, study, shop, your the preferred gas station, and countries you\u0026rsquo;ve travelled.\nAll this leads to a level of geospatial analysis never seen before, using all your social graph as an extra dimension. You could plot heatmaps showing location of people that liked your brand on FB, and use to optimize out-of-home media placement. Or monitor the consumers of a competitor brand when planning new physical stores. Basically it\u0026rsquo;s any marketer\u0026rsquo;s dream come true.\nOf course, it has just one small problem: it needs permission, and critical mass. You need tens of millions of users using the service, in order to have a meaningful representation.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why Andreas was so adamant when I asked him about his number one goal: \u0026ldquo;Growth. And fast\u0026rdquo;.\nUpdate 2012-05-04: it seems Facebook may agree with me here \u0026ndash; Facebook just announced they\u0026rsquo;re acquiring Glancee. I guess Andrea can scratch off \u0026ldquo;Growth\u0026rdquo; from his list.\n","permalink":"https://wrgms.com/glancee/","summary":"\u003ccenter\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Glancee at SXSW\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/content/images/2014/Feb/glancee.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/center\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy last session of SXSW Day 2 was with \u003ca href=\"http://andreavaccari.com/\"\u003eAndrea Vaccari\u003c/a\u003e, the CEO of the trendy location-based discovery startup \u003ca href=\"http://www.glancee.com/\"\u003eGlancee\u003c/a\u003e.

But despite recent progress with Content Network and YouTube, the marketing community still see the search giant as a way to drive conversion at the bottom of the funnel. In order to move to the next level, Google has to prove they can create emotional connections with consumers.\nEnter Project Re:Brief, just announced during SXSW.\nAccording to Aman Govil, Google\u0026rsquo;s Product Marketing Manager, the idea was to \u0026ldquo;re-imagine iconic campaigns of 4 classic global brands through the lenses of modern technology\u0026rdquo;. The project aims to be a benchmark of what is possible when you have the right idea and the perfect balance between creativity \u0026amp; technology.\nThe brands were carefully selected: Coca-Cola with Hilltop, Volvo with Drive it like you hate it, Avis We try harder, and Alka-Seltzer I can\u0026rsquo;t believe I ate the whole thing. The secret sauce was that they brought back from retirement the original creators of these 4 campaigns, and paired them with digital creatives, so they could re-imagine their original creations, leveraging today\u0026rsquo;s technology.\nIt was fascinating to see people like Harvey Gabor (Coca-Cola\u0026rsquo;s Hilltop, 1971) working with a bunch of twenty-something, and discovering how to use touch screens, mobile, realtime web.\nI had the opportunity to chat with Aman and Drew (the global creative director for the new campaigns) to understand how they pulled it together. Surprisingly, each project took just 2-3 months, and were executed with a relatively small budget (\u0026ldquo;Less than a TV spots\u0026rdquo;, told me Drew). Seems the advertisers were initially resistant to touch iconic pieces like Hilltop, but eventually understood the spirit of the project, and loved the opportunity to work with the original creators.\nWhat is even more fascinating is that not a single can of Coke or Alka-Seltzer was sold because this initiative. Google pulled this off not to help their clients sell more, but to help themseves. The target audience was marketers and agencies, hoping they would talk, comment, write blog posts. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t get more meta than this.\nCheck out more at www.projectrebrief.com, and look for the documentary later this year.\nUpdate 2012-06-22: the full documentary is now available on YouTube.\n","permalink":"https://wrgms.com/rebrief/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/content/images/2014/Feb/google_rebrief-1.png\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the past years Google has been trying to go beyond search, diversifying their revenue sources.

It took me some time to make it work like I wanted (keyboard, extensions, application menu, etc), but I\u0026rsquo;m quite happy with everything. Or almost everything.\nOne thing I enjoyed over the years was the ability to customize my keyboard shortcuts. I have dozens of shotcuts - to center windows on my screen, to open programs, start and stop Spotify, to run macros, to log in to my remote servers, and so on.\nOne of my handy shortcuts is \u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;F1\u0026gt; to open an xterm with superuser, and \u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;F2\u0026gt; for regular user. I use custom xterm profiles, so I can easily check if I\u0026rsquo;m running under a privileged context by looking at the color of the window.\nThis worked well for years under Ubuntu 14.04 and Gnome 3.20, but stopped working with the upgrade to Bionic Beaver. More specifically, \u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;F1\u0026gt; is now System Help, with no way to change it.\n\u0026ldquo;No problem\u0026rdquo;, I thought; this can be easily adjusted in System Settings.\nNops.\nI searched around, and found other folks with the same problem, but no solution.\nI then decided to dug into the source code, and discovered the improbable: Gnome devs decided the help was so important that it deserved its own unique, hardcoded, and immutable shortcut. If you want to reassign it, you\u0026rsquo;re out of luck.\nAccording to gnome-settings-daemon changelog:\n=============== Version 3.21.90 =============== ... Media keys: - Add Super+F1 as a hardcoded shortcut for launching Help ... REALLY? What\u0026rsquo;s wrong with a default icon in the toolbar, or maybe a popup window when you boot for the first time? Also, does anyone really care about reading the basic documentation for\u0026hellip; a windows manager?\nI wasn\u0026rsquo;t convinced yet, but a closer look at the source code confirmed my fear: there it was: (file /gnome-settings-daemon/blob/master/plugins/media-keys/shortcuts-list.h):\n{ HELP_KEY, NULL, N_(\u0026#34;Help\u0026#34;), \u0026#34;\u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;F1\u0026#34;, GSD_ACTION_MODE_LAUNCHER }, So if you\u0026rsquo;re really determined to regain control of your \u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;F1\u0026gt;, there\u0026rsquo;s only one solution: to recompile gnome-settings-daemon, and replace the gsd-media-keys plugin. Spoiler alert: I\u0026rsquo;m glad to report that my patch was successful, but beware: getting the right dependencies and recompiling Gnome is not an easy feat. Keep reading if you\u0026rsquo;re interested in doing the same:\nDownload and install Gnome Builder Click on \u0026ldquo;Clone\u0026rdquo;, select a local directory (e.g., ~/Projects/) and use the official repo at https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-settings-daemon Open xterm, and enter cd ~/Projects/gnome-settings-daemon; git checkout tags/GNOME_SETTINGS_DAEMON_3_28_1 (you can check your exact version with gnome-shell --version. Check all tags available with git tag -l) Install all dependencies. These were the ones missing in my system, but YMMV: apt install libcolord-dev \\ libgeocode-glib-dev \\ gnome-desktop3-data \\ libgnome-desktop-3-dev \\ libgweather-3-dev \\ libcanberra-gtk3-dev \\ libgeoclue-2-dev \\ libnotify-dev \\ libpulse-mainloop-glib0 \\ libpulse-dev \\ gobject-introspection \\ libupower-glib-dev \\ libpolkit-gobject-1-dev \\ libasound2-dev \\ libgudev-1.0-dev \\ libwacom-dev \\ libnss3-dev \\ libcups2-dev \\ libnm-dev Patch the source code by editing ~/Projects/gnome-settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/shortcuts-list.h, and add a comment in front of the offender, like below (for Gnome 3.28.1 it is in line 69): // disabled! // { HELP_KEY, NULL, N_(\u0026#34;Help\u0026#34;), \u0026#34;\u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;F1\u0026#34;, GSD_ACTION_MODE_LAUNCHER }, Click [Rebuild] button in the Builder UI to compile (note: you need to click Rebuild, and not Build). You may want to turn off the deprecation warnings by editing meson.build and adding '-Wno-deprecated-declarations' to test_cflags = [...]; (line 70). If you installed all the dependencies correctly, you should have no warnings nor errors. Find the compiled binaries. You\u0026rsquo;re looking specifically for the plugin gsd-media-keys, so it\u0026rsquo;ll likely be in the directory ~/.var/app/org.gnome.Builder/cache/gnome-builder/projects/gnome-settings-daemon/builds/default-host-HEAD/plugins/media-keys cd ~/.var/app/org.gnome.Builder/cache/gnome-builder/projects/gnome-settings-daemon/builds/default-host-HEAD/plugins/media-keys ~ cp ./gsd-media-keys ~/gsd-media-keys.patched Before proceeding, you may want to inspect your binary to confirm it successfully linked with shared libraries by using ldd ~/gsd-media-keys.patched. In my case I had problems finding libgsd.so, so I solved it by adding the path to ldconfig (although the correct solution would be to fix this in the build system): sudo sh -c \u0026#39;echo \u0026#34;# gnome-settings-daemon\\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gnome-settings-daemon-3.0/\\n\u0026#34; \u0026gt; /etc/ld.so.conf.d/gnome-settings-daemon.conf\u0026#39; sudo ldconfig You\u0026rsquo;re now ready to install the patched gsd-media-keys binary in your system: cd /usr/lib/gnome-settings-daemon/ sudo mv ~/gsd-media-keys.patched . sudo strip -s ./gsd-media-keys.patched sudo mv gsd-media-keys gsd-media-keys.orig sudo ln -s gsd-media-keys.patched gsd-media-keys Log out or reboot, and you\u0026rsquo;re done! If all goes well, your system now should be running the gsd-media-keys plugin without the \u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;F1\u0026gt; hardcoded, so you can reassign to anything you like.\nIf anything goes wrong and you can\u0026rsquo;t log in, don\u0026rsquo;t despair. Simply open a console terminal by using \u0026lt;Ctrl\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;Alt\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;F2\u0026gt; and restore your original gsd-media-keys binary by doing:\ncd /usr/lib/gnome-settings-daemon/ sudo rm gsd-media-keys sudo ln -s gsd-media-keys.orig gsd-media-keys Use \u0026lt;Ctrl\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;Alt\u0026gt;\u0026lt;F1\u0026gt; to go back to Gnome and log in again. You can then inspect /var/log/syslog to understand what went wrong (search for \u0026ldquo;media-keys\u0026rdquo;). It\u0026rsquo;s likely that you had problems with the dynamic libraries in step 8 above.\n","permalink":"https://wrgms.com/fixing-gnome-3-2x-hardcoded-superf1-shortcut/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eUbuntu 18.04 LTS is finally out, and with it you now have Gnome out of the box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve been using Gnome for several years, and have enjoyed its minimalism.

You may smile. But it will come…” [Henry Ford, 1940]\nFlying cars are not something new. The idea has been going around since the 19th century, even before the very first flight by Santos-Dumont (or Wright Brothers, depending on your bias). But it was The Jetsons who first brought the concept of flying cars to the masses. We grew up dreaming that one day we\u0026rsquo;d be able to get in our cars and fly straight to our destination - fast, safely, and traffic-free.\nThanks to Moore\u0026rsquo;s Law and the latest advances in engineering, we may be closer to flying cars than you think.\nAeroMobil is an innovative company from Slovakia, founded by Štefan Klein and Juraj Vaculik. Štefan, a well-known designer for Audi, Volkswagen and BMW, has been pursuing this idea for more than two decades. Juraj has a long and successful track record in advertising and as an investor. The two minds came together to create the company and make the dream a reality.\nDuring his talk at SXSW today, Juraj talked about the latest advances and their recent flying prototypes. As you can see on the two videos below, they made quite a progress between version 2.5 (early 2013) and 3.0 (late 2014).\nAeroMobil 2.5:\nAeroMobil 3.0: (note that Štefan himself test drives every prototype. He believes no one understand the machines better than him)\nDespite the progress, don\u0026rsquo;t expect to be driving - err.. flying - just yet. There are still several roadblocks (no pun intended) before mass adoption. They still need to figure out logistical challenges, like fueling stations, or grass strips next to roads for landing and take off. And change legislations, and define new testing procedures and certification. Or get people certified as pilots (yeah, don\u0026rsquo;t think your driver\u0026rsquo;s license will fly).\nBut with Google investing so heavily in self-driving cars, and SpaceX sending rockets to space, it\u0026rsquo;s not hard to imagine these efforts converging and eventually giving birth to self-driving flying cars. It might sound crazy at first, but there\u0026rsquo;s a good chance we\u0026rsquo;ll see it in our lifetime. AeroMobil may be in the exact spot that Paul Graham calls a Frighteningly Ambitious Startup Idea.\nCrazy? Yes.

With 800+ sessions this year, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to get overwhelmed. But get over your FOMO, and enjoy the serendipity. You will miss many good sessions, and that\u0026rsquo;s OK. The best talk will be that one you didn\u0026rsquo;t plan, and just entered because your first option was full.\nSpeaking of crowded sessions: always have a plan B. Your first option will likely be full, so having a second/third option is always important.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t go to panels. Ever. There\u0026rsquo;s hardly enough time for one person to convey a good idea in under 60 minutes. 4 or 5 becomes a festival of shallow sound bites. You already have Twitter for those.\nSeek geeky and obscure talks. The less buzzwords on the description, the better. Extra points if the talk is by someone who is actually making things - rather than people talking about those who made it. I saw some unbelievably good sessions in the past which had less 20 participants in the audience.\nBring an extra battery pack. Your phone will die midday, even if you have an iPhone 6 Plus. Pack some extra juice.\nPlan your commute time between sessions. Some venues are 2 miles away from Austin Convention Center, and shuttles may take 15-30 min door-to-door. Try Lyft/Uber, or pedicabs. Or you can be ultra-hipster and apply for a loaner Boosted Board. I already secured mine!\nDriving is usually a bad idea. Parking is expensive, and you may want to have a beer or two (or six or ten). Get an Uber/Lyft, or use the official shuttles, but be prepared to spend one hour each way. And remind yourself next time to book your ticket the exact minute they go on sale, and enjoy the convenience of a hotel in walking distance.\nHave a good breakfast. You won\u0026rsquo;t eat much during the day, and you\u0026rsquo;re probably still recovering from last night.\nRSVPs are usually useless. Most of the parties don\u0026rsquo;t require RSVP, and use it just to collect email addresses. And the ones that do are not the ones you see on blogs. [EDIT: this used to be true, but it\u0026rsquo;s now starting to change. Many parties are now respecting RSVPs, and even many of the talks in the official program started to require reservation, so play safe and do your homework.]\nRemember: SXSW is a marathon, not a sprint. It\u0026rsquo;s 5 full days (double if you do Music/Film), so take time to enjoy yourself. It\u0026rsquo;s Spring, and there\u0026rsquo;s no better time to be in Austin.

The requirements are:\nMust be able to listen continuously Run on embedded ARM processors (particuarly Raspberry Pi and BeagleBone Black) Good accuracy on a limited set of words (English only) Decent performance, particularly on low-power CPUs My first thought was to use Google Speech API. The accuracy is great, and it\u0026rsquo;s reasonably fast. But it is also limited to only 50 calls per day, so it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t satisfy requirement #1. And I don\u0026rsquo;t like the idea of streaming all of my personal conversations to anyone. It\u0026rsquo;s already enough to have NSA listening to my phone calls\u0026hellip;\n(maybe it\u0026rsquo;s an option for the future, when implementing something with a physical push-button, like a Star Trek communicator device)\nSiriProxy is another neat hack, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work with iOS7/8 anymore. Apple will soon offer an official interface to Siri via its HomeKit program, but it\u0026rsquo;ll only work with licensed hardware. Likely not an option for hackers and personal projects.\nAfter some research, I found CMUSphinx project, which seems to be the best project in the area of voice recognition. PocketSphinx toolkit is the version you want for embedded CPUs, as it\u0026rsquo;s pure C, and rather portable.\nThe documentation is not very friendly, but once you get it going, it works well.\nThe first step is to download and install SphinxBase, followed by PocketSphinx. The README has instructions to compile and install, but it\u0026rsquo;s the basic\n./configure make make install By default it\u0026rsquo;ll install binaries to /usr/local/bin, and language models to /usr/local/share. Make sure you have swig and alsa drivers installed before starting (apt-get install swig alsa-base alsa-utils).\nOnce installed, you need to figure out which dictionary model you want to use. Just for testing, I created a dictionary with 106 words, based on the old Logo language (remember the Logo turtle?), like forward, backward, turn right, turn left, etc.\nBefore you can start training PocketSphinx, you\u0026rsquo;ll need an acoustic model. Sadly, the speech corpus (i.e., audio files with spoken words) used to train the models are usually closed source. So either you spend a couple of hours recording the voices (or using an4/Voxforge) to train your own model, or you\u0026rsquo;ll skip this entirely and just use some of the built-in models, accepting lower accuracy. Given my limited number of words in the dictionary, I decided to go with built in acoustic models.\nNext, you need to describe your Language Model - the words, grammar, and frequency of words that you want to recognize. This tutorial has more details. If you\u0026rsquo;re in a hurry and just want to get PocketSphinx going with a dictionary for your pre-defined words, save yourself some trouble and use the online lmtool. This webservice will allow you to upload your dictionary file (a simple ASCII file, with one sentence or word per line), and it\u0026rsquo;ll generate all the language models you need to run PocketSphinx.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a sample of my dictionary file:\nannounce answer ask back clipboard color copy count ... sentence set space square root stamp wait wait until when who word If you want to play with this dictionary, download these files here, and run:\npocketsphinx_continuous -lm lm/logo.lm -dict lm/logo.dic (note: if pocketsphinx is stuck at READY, it\u0026rsquo;s probably listening to the wrong hw device. Check where is the microphone attached via cat /proc/asound/cards, and add -adcdev plughw:X,0 to the line above, replacing X by the hardware id of your microphone).\npocketsphinx_continuous -lm lm/logo.lm -dict lm/logo.dic -adcdev plughw:2,0 Smartphones use all sorts of tricks to cancel the background noise, but that requires special hardware, so you\u0026rsquo;ll need a reasonable quiet environment. Otherwise the accuracy will suffer, depending on how large your dictionary is.\nAs you would expect, smaller dictionaries have much better accuracy. With a 100-word, I got 60-70% correct. After I reduced to a simple 15-words dictionary, I got virtually 100% match rate, even with some background noise and a non-American accent. Certainly enough for my projects.\nNext up: running this on a Raspberry Pi, installing a decent openair microphone, and testing overall performance when connected to a home automation system.

It\u0026rsquo;s a shame that Linux keyboard is still horribly broken by default (some may say it\u0026rsquo;s by design; no, it\u0026rsquo;s not).\nIt has been asked before, but most answers will point you to use xim, which will open another can of worms.

Some say it\u0026rsquo;ll the the digital renaissance; others claim it\u0026rsquo;s the best thing to ever happen to the web, after the browser itself.\nThis video summarizes well the sentiment:\nThis is wrong.\nTen years from now we\u0026rsquo;ll look back and realize how much the new gTLDs have hurt us.\nFirst, most of the new gTLDs add little or no value. I bet we could live another 50 years without a .ninja, a .soy, .fail, .florist, or .loans.\nOthers will proclaim that the new gTLDs are useful, and point to domains like .nyc, .london, or .website, as examples of the \u0026ldquo;democratization\u0026rdquo; promoted by the new categories.\nBut these will be the exception rather than the rule. In practice the new gTLDS will force brands to spend millions of dollars to protect against cybersquatters rushing to claim new brand-related domains, amongst other threats.\nBefore you had to register your brand across a handful of TLDs. Now you have 1,400 more to worry about. That\u0026rsquo;s like a whack-a-mole game, but you\u0026rsquo;re outnumbered by hundreds of moles for each hand you have.\nAnd yet, this is not my main concern. Brands got screwed and will spend a ton of money, while domain registrars will be laughing all the way to the bank. Whatever, life will be fine.\nMy concern is a different one: the new gTLDs will accelerate the demise of the URI.\nWe already lost users to search. It\u0026rsquo;s more convenient to type \u0026ldquo;Brand\u0026rdquo; on the browser and let your search engine do the rest than typing \u0026ldquo;brand.com\u0026rdquo;. And on mobile the URL is already hidden from the user, as if it were an irrelevant technical implementation detail. Same on Safari on desktop.\nBut now multiply this situation by thousands of gTLDs, and you\u0026rsquo;ll have the perfect Paradox of Choice. Is it a .com, a .net, .cc? Nops. Keep going friend.\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s add to the mix the fact that a) most of the mobile traffic is already coming from native apps, and b) Apple is pushing to bury the URI, and c) Google is replacing everything by its omni-search. And we\u0026rsquo;re not even talking about Siri or voice-activated search. This will result in a very different world. My prediction: thanks to the new gTLDs, mobile apps and commercial players will have even more control than today, and URLs will be demoted to second-class citizens. They will still be there, but buried somewhere in the sub-menus of your browser, or the API of your Chrome extensions. Just like IP addresses; you know it\u0026rsquo;s there somewhere, but nobody cares.\nIn the name of find-ability and ease of use, we\u0026rsquo;ll live in an URL-less world. And commercial entities will be rewarded and profit from your traffic.\nI\u0026rsquo;m sure that\u0026rsquo;s not the web that Sir Tim Berners-Lee envisioned 25 years ago.\n","permalink":"https://wrgms.com/gtlds-and-the-death-of-urls/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eUnless you\u0026rsquo;ve been living under a rock, you\u0026rsquo;ve read \u003cem\u003ead nauseum\u003c/em\u003e about the overly optimistic predictions for the new gTLDs.

Wrong.\nBut this time I was the one to blame.\nAfter solving the conflict with bash, I changed /etc/passwd user shell to /bin/bash. The only problem is that Synology wipes the system partition during firmware upgrades, so when I upgraded to DSM 4.1.2668, my custom `/bin/bash``was gone. Of course this locked me out of the system. No SSH, SCP or FTP. Great.\nAfter a few moments of panic, I remembered I still had the serial console. So I could put Linux in single user mode, and drop into recovery mode.\nSo if you\u0026rsquo;re ever in a similar situation, here\u0026rsquo;s how to fix it:\n1. First, you need a serial console.\n2. During U-Boot, press any key to cancel the automatic kernel boot (Hit any key to stop autoboot).\n3. Enter printenv to check the environment variables. Search for bootargs and bootm variables (they will be different on your system, so do NOT copy and paste from mine, unless you have a Synology DS212+ with the same DSM).\n4. Append reboot=cold,hard emergency init=/bin/sh to the end of bootargs variable. In my case, this is what I used:\nsetenv bootargs \u0026#39;console=ttyS0,115200 ip=off initrd=0x00800040,4M root=/dev/md0 rw syno_hw_version=DS212pv20 ihd_num=2 netif_num=1 esata_7042=1 reboot=cold,hard emergency init=/bin/sh\u0026#39; (again, your parameters will likely be different, so don\u0026rsquo;t copy and paste)\n5. Boot your kernel, with\nbootm F8080000 F8280000 Now your Synology should be happily botting in single user mode, ignoring /etc/passwd and dropping you to a plain shell. Do what you have to do to fix the system, and reboot.\nYou can also use these steps to recover your system partition from a crash or other problem.\n","permalink":"https://wrgms.com/entering-single-user-mode-on-a-synology/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/content/images/2019/06/upowerd.png\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"alt text\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/content/images/2013/01/synology.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hope this will be my last post about Synology for a while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter dealing for a few weeks with an \u003ca href=\"http://forum.synology.com/enu/viewtopic.php?f=221\u0026amp;t=59808\u0026amp;start=45#p232455\"\u003eunstable environment\u003c/a\u003e, then \u003ca href=\"/recovering-a-failed-synology-diskstation-ds2xx-serial\"\u003ehacking a serial console\u003c/a\u003e to troubleshoot, then \u003ca href=\"/synologys-secret-telnet-password/\"\u003ecracking the secret recovery telnet password\u003c/a\u003e just for fun, and finally solving the \u003ca href=\"http://serverfault.com/questions/458553/cant-log-in-via-ssh-to-any-accounts-set-to-use-bin-bash-as-a-default-shell/\"\u003eweird mistery\u003c/a\u003e of SSH \u003ca href=\"/reverse-engineering-synology-openssh\"\u003enot accepting /bin/bash as default shell\u003c/a\u003e, I thought I finally had a stable environment.

Maybe /etc/shells? Nops. Maybe sshd_config? No. PAM modules, then? Also not. I even tried compiling bash from source (which took me a full day, just to get ARM GCC to cross compile properly).

The user has to be called \u0026ldquo;root\u0026rdquo;.\nWHAAAT?\nThankfully, Synology uses a modified Linux distribution, so they publish the code under GPL.\nAfter a couple of hours looking at the OpenSSH source code, things became pretty obvious. Here\u0026rsquo;s the piece of code from their version of OpenSSH 5.8p1, file session.c:\nvoid do_child(Session *s, const char *command) { ... #ifdef MY_ABC_HERE char szValue[8]; int RunSSH = 0; SSH_CMD SSHCmd = REQ_UNKNOWN; if (1 == GetKeyValue(\u0026#34;/etc/synoinfo.conf\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;runssh\u0026#34;, szValue, sizeof(szValue))) { if (strcasecmp(szValue, \u0026#34;yes\u0026#34;) == 0) { RunSSH = 1; } } if (IsSFTPReq(command)){ SSHCmd = REQ_SFTP; } else if (IsRsyncReq(command)){ SSHCmd = REQ_RSYNC; } else if (IsTimebkpRequest(command)){ SSHCmd = REQ_TIMEBKP; } else if (RunSSH \u0026amp;amp;\u0026amp;amp; IsAllowShell(pw)){ SSHCmd = REQ_SHELL; } else { goto Err; } if (REQ_RSYNC == SSHCmd) { pw = SYNOChgValForRsync(pw); } if (!SSHCanLogin(SSHCmd, pw)) { goto Err; } goto Pass; Err: fprintf(stderr, \u0026#34;Permission denied, please try again.\\n\u0026#34;); exit(1); Pass: #endif /* MY_ABC_HERE */ ... } And here is the IsAllowShell(pw):\nstatic int IsAllowShell(const struct passwd *pw) { struct passwd *pUnPrivilege = NULL; char *szUserName = NULL; if (!pw || !pw-\u0026amp;gt;pw_name) { return 0; } szUserName = pw-\u0026amp;gt;pw_name; if(!strcmp(szUserName, \u0026#34;root\u0026#34;) || !strcmp(szUserName, \u0026#34;admin\u0026#34;)){ return 1; } if (NULL != (pUnPrivilege = getpwnam(szUserName))){ if (!strcmp(pUnPrivilege-\u0026amp;gt;pw_shell, \u0026#34;/bin/sh\u0026#34;) || !strcmp(pUnPrivilege-\u0026amp;gt;pw_shell, \u0026#34;/bin/ash\u0026#34;)) { return 1; } } return 0; } Basically synology created a heavily customized version of OpenSSH, including a handful of hacks - e.g., additional checking before accepting a login to see if the SSH service is enabled within the web interface, or stripping special chars (;, |, \u0026lsquo;) from rsync commands, and\u0026hellip; wait for it\u0026hellip; blocking anyone other than root or admin from using any shell other than /bin/sh or /bin/ash.\nOnce identified the cause, the fix was easy: just remove the call to IsAllowShell(). Cross-compile, upload to the NAS, reboot and voilà, regular users can now use bash normally.\nThe hardest part was to get cross-compiling working properly.

Or you simply don\u0026rsquo;t like the idea of having your port 23 open to the world for god-knows-how-long until a Synology tech support can look into your case.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ve probably tried telneting to your NAS. Maybe you\u0026rsquo;ve even tried opening the case and hacking the serial port, only to discover that you don\u0026rsquo;t have the root password. The DS Assistant password doesn\u0026rsquo;t work, and you exhausted all obvious guesses - blank, synopass, synology, password, admin, root, etc.\nWell, what about c12-0804? No, I didn\u0026rsquo;t make this up. This is today\u0026rsquo;s password.\nBut if you\u0026rsquo;re reading this a few days (or years) from now, too bad; it won\u0026rsquo;t work. Unless, of course, you wait until December 8th. Because the password repeats every year.\nBasically Synology hardcoded a modified login binary within the firmware that accepts an obfuscated password for root, which depends on the current date. (by the way, this isn\u0026rsquo;t the only thing Synology folks hardcoded in the firmware).\nThanks to GPL, Synology was forced to publish the original source code for the firmware. Based on the original correct_password.c code, I hacked a short snippet to generate the daily password.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the Synology Telnet password generator:\n#include \u0026amp;lt;stdlib.h\u0026amp;gt; #include \u0026amp;lt;time.h\u0026amp;gt; #include \u0026amp;lt;stdio.h\u0026amp;gt; void main() { struct timeval tvTime; struct tm tmOutput; gettimeofday(\u0026amp;amp;tvTime, 0); localtime_r(\u0026amp;amp;(tvTime.tv_sec), \u0026amp;amp;tmOutput); tmOutput.tm_mon += 1; printf(\u0026#34;password for today is: %x%02d-%02x%02d\\n\\n\u0026#34;, tmOutput.tm_mon, tmOutput.tm_mon, tmOutput.tm_mday, gcd(tmOutput.tm_mon, tmOutput.tm_mday)); } int gcd(int a, int b) { return (b?gcd(b,a%b):a); } Compile and run the code above with gcc. You can also use the excellent Codepad Repl.it to run the code online and get the password for today (no registration needed).\nBonus tip: if you\u0026rsquo;re curious how exactly the password is generated, here\u0026rsquo;s the algorithm:\n1st character = month in hexadecimal, lower case (1=Jan, \u0026hellip; , a=Oct, b=Nov, c=Dec) 2-3 = month in decimal, zero padded and starting in 1 (01, 02, 03, \u0026hellip;, 11, 12) 4 = dash 5-6 = day of the month in hex (01, 02 .., 0A, .., 1F) 7-8 = greatest common divisor between month and day, zero padded. This is always a number between 01 and 12. So, let\u0026rsquo;s say today is October 15, the password would be: a10-0f05 where a = month in hex, 10 = month in decimal, 0f = day in hex, 05 = greatest divisor between 10 and 15).\nIf you have trouble calculating the greatest common divisor (elementary math, anyone?), Wolfram Alpha is your friend.\nThis was tested on a Synology DS212+, with Marvell Kirkwood mv6282 chipset. It\u0026rsquo;s unlikely but still possible that different models use a different algorithm. YMMV, so always check the source code.\n[UPDATE 1: Several users reported that this works in many other models, including DS409, DS112j, etc. Please leave a comment with your model and firmware version.]\n[UPDATE 2: If it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work, it\u0026rsquo;s probably that your date is incorrect in the NAS. Per Patrick\u0026rsquo;s suggestion in the comments below, try \u0026ldquo;101-0101\u0026rdquo;, which is the password for Jan 01]\n","permalink":"https://wrgms.com/synologys-secret-telnet-password/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIf you have a Synology NAS and had some sort of disk crash in the past, you\u0026rsquo;ve probably encountered the famous \u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;Cannot format system partition\u0026rdquo;\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;Please configure your router to forward port 23 to DiskStation and contact Synology online support\u0026rdquo;\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, it sucks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt sucks even more when you know the disk is perfectly fine, and you still have hopes to recover your data.

The software is robust and much better than my old DroboFS, and the fact that it is entirely open source is a big plus.\nI recently upgraded the firmware to DSM 2661. Everything worked fine. For 12 hours. The next morning, the device was dead, with the blue blink of death).\nWas it the new firmware? Or maybe a disk crash? Who knows.\nI followed the basic tests recommended by Synology: remove both disks, turn it on and wait 30s for a long beep. Beeeeeep. Great, the motherboard is still functional. It also responded to ping and showed up on DS Assistant, so processor and ethernet are also working fine.\nThe Synology DS NAS is basically an embedded Linux box, using md + lvm for RAID. Nothing is proprietary, so I mounted the disks on my Linux desktop and spent a few more hours cloning and re-building the RAID using a spare disk. Life is good.\nTill\u0026hellip; it crashed again.\nThere was something wrong with the system partition, so I wanted to see inside the NAS, before the kernel finishes booting.\nThankfully, Synology folks already put a physical serial port in there. It\u0026rsquo;s not documented, but it\u0026rsquo;s not hard to find. You just have to open the case.\nDisclaimer: make sure you have backup! I am not responsible if you lose your data, void your warranty, burn down your house or kill your dog.\nStart by opening the case. Here\u0026rsquo;s a video with instructions [update: the original video is not available anymore, but here\u0026rsquo;s a similar one]. Be aware this may break the small internal hooks, and you\u0026rsquo;ll need to use tape or hot glue to put it back together (what\u0026rsquo;s wrong with manufacturers these days? What\u0026rsquo;s the problem with good old screws?) Inside the case, look for a 6-pin header, normally labeled JP2 (or COM1 on older models). The pins likely are: Pin Number Function Confirmed on Synology DS212+ \u0026nbsp; 13.3V 2GND 4TX 6RX Now connect the pins 2, 4 and 6 (respectively GNS, TX, RX) to your USB-TTL 3v3 cable (if using the FTDI cable from Adafruit, it\u0026rsquo;ll be 1-black, 5-yellow, 4-orange. Make sure you don\u0026rsquo;t short-circuit any of the pins. These male-female jumper wires could be useful. Open your preferred terminal program (under Win ExtraPutty is the best in town), set to 115200, disable xon/xoff, and you\u0026rsquo;re all set. Now you can turn on your DS, and see all the beauty of what\u0026rsquo;s going on under the hood:\n__ __ _ _ | \\/ | __ _ _ ____ _____| | | | |\\/| |/ _` | \u0026#39;__\\ \\ / / _ \\ | | | | | | (_| | | \\ V / __/ | | |_| |_|\\__,_|_| \\_/ \\___|_|_| _ _ ____ _ | | | | | __ ) ___ ___ | |_ | | | |___| _ \\ / _ \\ / _ \\| __| | |_| |___| |_) | (_) | (_) | |_ \\___/ |____/ \\___/ \\___/ \\__| ** LOADER ** ** MARVELL BOARD: Synology Disk Station LE U-Boot 1.1.4 (Dec 2 2011 - 15:56:02) Marvell version: 3.5.9 U-Boot code: 00600000 -\u0026amp;gt; 0067FFF0 BSS: -\u0026amp;gt; 0068B3D4 Soc: 88F6282 A1CPU running @ 2000Mhz L2 running @ 500Mhz SysClock = 500Mhz , TClock = 200Mhz DRAM (DDR3) CAS Latency = 7 tRP = 7 tRAS = 20 tRCD=7 DRAM CS[0] base 0x00000000 size 256MB DRAM CS[1] base 0x10000000 size 256MB DRAM Total size 512MB 16bit width Addresses 8M - 0M are saved for the U-Boot usage.

It\u0026rsquo;s sad to see so much work and love going nowhere. At least they were classy and wrote a candid and honest shutting-down post, and they\u0026rsquo;re even refunding users (!). That\u0026rsquo;s a level of integrity that you don\u0026rsquo;t see everyday in the startup world.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;ve never played Glitch, it\u0026rsquo;s now too late. The game world is now restricted to existing users, and everything will shut down on December 9th 2012. Here\u0026rsquo;s some videos to give you an idea of what you missed.\nI was part of the first wave of beta testers. Even though I\u0026rsquo;ve never spent much time playing, I remember how every detail was carefullyt thought through, and painstakenly executed. The videos don\u0026rsquo;t do justice to their attention to detail.\nBut, aside from the intrinsic beauty, the gameplay was dull. It was just a cute massive multiplayer social game. Maybe the cutest ever. But without a strong storytelling or any of the gamification tactics from other social gaming companies, there was no reason for you to keep coming back.\nIn a world of \u0026ldquo;Your crops are dying! Your friend Samantha just moved to a farm next door. Invite your friends to level up faster.\u0026rdquo;, it\u0026rsquo;s hard to keep users engaged these days.\nThis reminds me of the Steve Blank\u0026rsquo;s MVP stories. Do you need to develop a full game, with so many levels, intricate dialogues, dozens of non-playable characters, only to realize that your users aren\u0026rsquo;t coming back in the first place?\nCan\u0026rsquo;t you create a demo with a couple of levels and a handful of hard-coded NPCs, and invite your mom/sister/significant other to play? Just check how many times they come back (when you\u0026rsquo;re not looking). You\u0026rsquo;ll achieve the same conclusions, with 10% of the effort.\nOf course hindsight is a bitch \u0026ndash; or, like someone said on HN: \u0026quot;\u0026hellip;hindsight is a Glitch\u0026quot; :). Sometimes you can\u0026rsquo;t just hack an MVP together; you need a fully polished product. But I don\u0026rsquo;t think that\u0026rsquo;s the case here.\nIt seems to me they put too much effort on having a full product, and lost sight of the bigger picture. They repeated some of the same fatal mistakes others have done. For example, Lessons from Habitat outlines many of the same pitfalls, as seen by the creators of Lucasfilm in the mid-80\u0026rsquo;s. The entire paper is a great read, but one part that strikes me as relevant to this discussion:\n\u0026ldquo;While we find much of the work presently being done on elaborate interface technologies \u0026ndash; DataGloves, head-mounted displays, special-purpose rendering engines, and so on \u0026ndash; both exciting and promising, the almost mystical euphoria that currently seems to surround all this hardware is, in our opinion, both excessive and somewhat misplaced.\nWe can\u0026rsquo;t help having a nagging sense that it\u0026rsquo;s all a bit of a distraction from the really pressing issues.\n*At the core of our vision is the idea that cyberspace is necessarily a multiple-participant environment. It seems to us that the things that are important to the inhabitants of such an environment are the capabilities available to them, the characteristics of the other people they encounter there, and the ways these various participants can affect one another.\nBeyond a foundation set of communications capabilities, the details of the technology used to present this environment to its participants, while sexy and interesting, are of relatively peripheral concern.\u0026rdquo;\nKeep in mind the first Habitat was launched in 1986, almost 30 years ago, and ran in 64Kb on a Commodore64.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re now spoiled by Call Of Duty and hyper-realist NBA games. But there\u0026rsquo;s a point to be made that the success of an MMO game is not defined by its level of peripheral sophistication (be it design, cuteness, or head-mounted displays), but by the social experience, and how people interact with each other. Minecraft, with its blocky graphics and limited interactivity, is a prime example.\nGlitch isn\u0026rsquo;t alone in repeating these mistakes. Worlds Chat did the same two decades ago, being the first 3D world ever created. It was later replaced by The Palace. Later Philip Rosedale had his chance with Second Life, which exploded, then burst, and now is becoming cool again (and Philip is trying his hand again with High Fidelity).\nAnother issue with Glitch was its channel distribution. It\u0026rsquo;s challenging in 2012 to succeed with a web-only game, especially if you\u0026rsquo;re not anchored on Facebook. And Glitch was built in Flash (!), so it missed billions of 2-3 minutes slots of free time that people have when waiting for the train, bathroom, elevator.

Sony. HBGary Hack. FBI. Paypal, Visa \u0026amp; MasterCard. Mubarak. Occupy Wall Street. SOPA/PIPA.\nAnonymous has been busy for the past few years. It started as juvenile pranks on 4chan\u0026rsquo;s boards, but grew and became a powerful mechanism against oppressive governments and unscrupulous corporations.\nIts trajectory was beautifully captured in the documentary \u0026ldquo;We Are Legion: The Story of the Hacktivists\u0026rdquo;, that will be released later this year. I had the pleasure to watch the premiere in Austin during SXSW, and I must say - it\u0026rsquo;s f..ing brilliant. The movie is still in post-production, so the theatrical release may be slightly different.\nWe also participated in an exclusive interview with the film director \u0026ldquo;Brian Knappenberger\u0026rdquo;, who was joined on stage by former Anonymous member Gregg Housh and two special guests Anon behind masks: one from Austin, and another just called Anonymous9000, connecting via Skype from an undisclosed location (and using a robotic voice changer). It was a surreal experience.\nTogether they gave a passionate and fascinating perspective of the evolution of Anonymous, its internal workings, and the journey since 4Chan to the present day. They discussed how the group went after the Church of Scientology, why they hacked HBGary, discussed the release of confidential data of Sony customers, and how lately they\u0026rsquo;ve started to engage in social movements around freedom, Occupy Wall Street, the Arab Spring, and the support to Wikileaks\u0026rsquo; founder, Julian Assange.\nA few highlights of the session, in no particular order:\nsome Anons don\u0026rsquo;t agree with the dump of personal information (like in Sony\u0026rsquo;s case). But a few radical sub-groups - like Lulzsec - have a different opinion, and believe the press only pays attention when something concrete happens. Ironically, one of the most vocal supporters of dumping personal data was Sabu - which was revealed last week to be an FBI informant since June 2011. Conflict of interest, maybe?\nAnons in general don\u0026rsquo;t support attacking the press, as they believe in freedom of expression themselves (even when it is press against Anonymous). Some may disagree. Others simply don\u0026rsquo;t care; they\u0026rsquo;re in for the lulz, and accuse others of being moralfags. It\u0026rsquo;s these constant disagreements within Anonymous\u0026rsquo; anarchic structure that gave birth to dissidents, like Lulzsec.\n\u0026ldquo;Thousands of twenty-something socially awkward nerds got laid for the first time due to these movements and events in real life. Behind a mask, they all felt more comfortable in expressing themselves and talking with girls. We saw several marriages between Anons that met while protesting against the Church of Scientology and others\u0026rdquo;.\n\u0026ldquo;The DDoS attacks have just one objective: attract press. Whenever we have a message that we want the press to distribute, we DDoS someone so the press will publish the news that Anonymous attacked again, followed by what we wanted them to communicate. Otherwise we\u0026rsquo;d be just ignored. Look at SOPA/PIPA; we\u0026rsquo;ve been talking about this for years, and no one ever cared. Then we DDoS\u0026rsquo;d RIAA/MPAA/DoJ websites\u0026hellip; and the press showed up in full force overnight.\u0026rdquo;\nWatch the trailer here [YouTube].\nUpdate 2012-11-17: now also available for rental on Vimeo. This is the first time that Vimeo does movie rental. EDIT: Vimeo link is broken, but as of May 2025 it is now available on YouTube.\nUpdate 2012-10-17: it is opening in theatres this weekend. NY, LA, Houston, Canada, Rio de Janeiro and others. Check to see if your city is in the list. You can also pre-order the movie, starting on 10/30.

If you\u0026rsquo;re not one of the 12,000 people already using the service (that\u0026rsquo;s the number Andrea gave during the talk), well\u0026hellip; you should give it a try, because everyone is talking about it. Yeah, I live in the echo chamber, I know.\nGlancee, like its competitors Highlight, Sonar, Banjo, are all exploring the new niche of location social discovery - some sort of Match.com-meets-LinkedIn. Unproven territory, but sounds promising (albeit somewhat dystopian) to me. Andrea spoke about the current status of social discovery apps and the different approaches taken by each player. He also mentioned the incredible growth (hard to see 12,000 as incredible, but startup founders have to drink their own Kool-Aid), particularly with all the buzz around SXSW.\nBut to me the most interesting tidbit was the concept of monetizing the service via Spatial Analysis.\nHe didn\u0026rsquo;t elaborate much, so let me speculate a bit here. Consider that you have a device on your pocket that is connected to Facebook (i.e. knows everything about your attitudinal behavior - including Likes, affinity with brands, reach, friends). You have Glancee installed, and as such it is constantly broadcasting your current geolocation. Every. Single. Minute. Like Google Latitude, but with a Facebook social layer on top of it.\nNot only it knows who you are and what you like, but also where you\u0026rsquo;ve been, where you work, live, play, study, shop, your the preferred gas station, and countries you\u0026rsquo;ve travelled.\nAll this leads to a level of geospatial analysis never seen before, using all your social graph as an extra dimension. You could plot heatmaps showing location of people that liked your brand on FB, and use to optimize out-of-home media placement. Or monitor the consumers of a competitor brand when planning new physical stores. Basically it\u0026rsquo;s any marketer\u0026rsquo;s dream come true.\nOf course, it has just one small problem: it needs permission, and critical mass. You need tens of millions of users using the service, in order to have a meaningful representation.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why Andreas was so adamant when I asked him about his number one goal: \u0026ldquo;Growth. And fast\u0026rdquo;.\nUpdate 2012-05-04: it seems Facebook may agree with me here \u0026ndash; Facebook just announced they\u0026rsquo;re acquiring Glancee. I guess Andrea can scratch off \u0026ldquo;Growth\u0026rdquo; from his list.\n","permalink":"https://wrgms.com/glancee/","summary":"\u003ccenter\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Glancee at SXSW\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/content/images/2014/Feb/glancee.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/center\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy last session of SXSW Day 2 was with \u003ca href=\"http://andreavaccari.com/\"\u003eAndrea Vaccari\u003c/a\u003e, the CEO of the trendy location-based discovery startup \u003ca href=\"http://www.glancee.com/\"\u003eGlancee\u003c/a\u003e.

But despite recent progress with Content Network and YouTube, the marketing community still see the search giant as a way to drive conversion at the bottom of the funnel. In order to move to the next level, Google has to prove they can create emotional connections with consumers.\nEnter Project Re:Brief, just announced during SXSW.\nAccording to Aman Govil, Google\u0026rsquo;s Product Marketing Manager, the idea was to \u0026ldquo;re-imagine iconic campaigns of 4 classic global brands through the lenses of modern technology\u0026rdquo;. The project aims to be a benchmark of what is possible when you have the right idea and the perfect balance between creativity \u0026amp; technology.\nThe brands were carefully selected: Coca-Cola with Hilltop, Volvo with Drive it like you hate it, Avis We try harder, and Alka-Seltzer I can\u0026rsquo;t believe I ate the whole thing. The secret sauce was that they brought back from retirement the original creators of these 4 campaigns, and paired them with digital creatives, so they could re-imagine their original creations, leveraging today\u0026rsquo;s technology.\nIt was fascinating to see people like Harvey Gabor (Coca-Cola\u0026rsquo;s Hilltop, 1971) working with a bunch of twenty-something, and discovering how to use touch screens, mobile, realtime web.\nI had the opportunity to chat with Aman and Drew (the global creative director for the new campaigns) to understand how they pulled it together. Surprisingly, each project took just 2-3 months, and were executed with a relatively small budget (\u0026ldquo;Less than a TV spots\u0026rdquo;, told me Drew). Seems the advertisers were initially resistant to touch iconic pieces like Hilltop, but eventually understood the spirit of the project, and loved the opportunity to work with the original creators.\nWhat is even more fascinating is that not a single can of Coke or Alka-Seltzer was sold because this initiative. Google pulled this off not to help their clients sell more, but to help themseves. The target audience was marketers and agencies, hoping they would talk, comment, write blog posts. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t get more meta than this.\nCheck out more at www.projectrebrief.com, and look for the documentary later this year.\nUpdate 2012-06-22: the full documentary is now available on YouTube.\n","permalink":"https://wrgms.com/rebrief/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/content/images/2014/Feb/google_rebrief-1.png\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the past years Google has been trying to go beyond search, diversifying their revenue sources.

It took me some time to make it work like I wanted (keyboard, extensions, application menu, etc), but I\u0026rsquo;m quite happy with everything. Or almost everything.\nOne thing I enjoyed over the years was the ability to customize my keyboard shortcuts. I have dozens of shotcuts - to center windows on my screen, to open programs, start and stop Spotify, to run macros, to log in to my remote servers, and so on.\nOne of my handy shortcuts is \u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;F1\u0026gt; to open an xterm with superuser, and \u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;F2\u0026gt; for regular user. I use custom xterm profiles, so I can easily check if I\u0026rsquo;m running under a privileged context by looking at the color of the window.\nThis worked well for years under Ubuntu 14.04 and Gnome 3.20, but stopped working with the upgrade to Bionic Beaver. More specifically, \u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;F1\u0026gt; is now System Help, with no way to change it.\n\u0026ldquo;No problem\u0026rdquo;, I thought; this can be easily adjusted in System Settings.\nNops.\nI searched around, and found other folks with the same problem, but no solution.\nI then decided to dug into the source code, and discovered the improbable: Gnome devs decided the help was so important that it deserved its own unique, hardcoded, and immutable shortcut. If you want to reassign it, you\u0026rsquo;re out of luck.\nAccording to gnome-settings-daemon changelog:\n=============== Version 3.21.90 =============== ... Media keys: - Add Super+F1 as a hardcoded shortcut for launching Help ... REALLY? What\u0026rsquo;s wrong with a default icon in the toolbar, or maybe a popup window when you boot for the first time? Also, does anyone really care about reading the basic documentation for\u0026hellip; a windows manager?\nI wasn\u0026rsquo;t convinced yet, but a closer look at the source code confirmed my fear: there it was: (file /gnome-settings-daemon/blob/master/plugins/media-keys/shortcuts-list.h):\n{ HELP_KEY, NULL, N_(\u0026#34;Help\u0026#34;), \u0026#34;\u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;F1\u0026#34;, GSD_ACTION_MODE_LAUNCHER }, So if you\u0026rsquo;re really determined to regain control of your \u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;F1\u0026gt;, there\u0026rsquo;s only one solution: to recompile gnome-settings-daemon, and replace the gsd-media-keys plugin. Spoiler alert: I\u0026rsquo;m glad to report that my patch was successful, but beware: getting the right dependencies and recompiling Gnome is not an easy feat. Keep reading if you\u0026rsquo;re interested in doing the same:\nDownload and install Gnome Builder Click on \u0026ldquo;Clone\u0026rdquo;, select a local directory (e.g., ~/Projects/) and use the official repo at https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-settings-daemon Open xterm, and enter cd ~/Projects/gnome-settings-daemon; git checkout tags/GNOME_SETTINGS_DAEMON_3_28_1 (you can check your exact version with gnome-shell --version. Check all tags available with git tag -l) Install all dependencies. These were the ones missing in my system, but YMMV: apt install libcolord-dev \\ libgeocode-glib-dev \\ gnome-desktop3-data \\ libgnome-desktop-3-dev \\ libgweather-3-dev \\ libcanberra-gtk3-dev \\ libgeoclue-2-dev \\ libnotify-dev \\ libpulse-mainloop-glib0 \\ libpulse-dev \\ gobject-introspection \\ libupower-glib-dev \\ libpolkit-gobject-1-dev \\ libasound2-dev \\ libgudev-1.0-dev \\ libwacom-dev \\ libnss3-dev \\ libcups2-dev \\ libnm-dev Patch the source code by editing ~/Projects/gnome-settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/shortcuts-list.h, and add a comment in front of the offender, like below (for Gnome 3.28.1 it is in line 69): // disabled! // { HELP_KEY, NULL, N_(\u0026#34;Help\u0026#34;), \u0026#34;\u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;F1\u0026#34;, GSD_ACTION_MODE_LAUNCHER }, Click [Rebuild] button in the Builder UI to compile (note: you need to click Rebuild, and not Build). You may want to turn off the deprecation warnings by editing meson.build and adding '-Wno-deprecated-declarations' to test_cflags = [...]; (line 70). If you installed all the dependencies correctly, you should have no warnings nor errors. Find the compiled binaries. You\u0026rsquo;re looking specifically for the plugin gsd-media-keys, so it\u0026rsquo;ll likely be in the directory ~/.var/app/org.gnome.Builder/cache/gnome-builder/projects/gnome-settings-daemon/builds/default-host-HEAD/plugins/media-keys cd ~/.var/app/org.gnome.Builder/cache/gnome-builder/projects/gnome-settings-daemon/builds/default-host-HEAD/plugins/media-keys ~ cp ./gsd-media-keys ~/gsd-media-keys.patched Before proceeding, you may want to inspect your binary to confirm it successfully linked with shared libraries by using ldd ~/gsd-media-keys.patched. In my case I had problems finding libgsd.so, so I solved it by adding the path to ldconfig (although the correct solution would be to fix this in the build system): sudo sh -c \u0026#39;echo \u0026#34;# gnome-settings-daemon\\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gnome-settings-daemon-3.0/\\n\u0026#34; \u0026gt; /etc/ld.so.conf.d/gnome-settings-daemon.conf\u0026#39; sudo ldconfig You\u0026rsquo;re now ready to install the patched gsd-media-keys binary in your system: cd /usr/lib/gnome-settings-daemon/ sudo mv ~/gsd-media-keys.patched . sudo strip -s ./gsd-media-keys.patched sudo mv gsd-media-keys gsd-media-keys.orig sudo ln -s gsd-media-keys.patched gsd-media-keys Log out or reboot, and you\u0026rsquo;re done! If all goes well, your system now should be running the gsd-media-keys plugin without the \u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;F1\u0026gt; hardcoded, so you can reassign to anything you like.\nIf anything goes wrong and you can\u0026rsquo;t log in, don\u0026rsquo;t despair. Simply open a console terminal by using \u0026lt;Ctrl\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;Alt\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;F2\u0026gt; and restore your original gsd-media-keys binary by doing:\ncd /usr/lib/gnome-settings-daemon/ sudo rm gsd-media-keys sudo ln -s gsd-media-keys.orig gsd-media-keys Use \u0026lt;Ctrl\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;Alt\u0026gt;\u0026lt;F1\u0026gt; to go back to Gnome and log in again. You can then inspect /var/log/syslog to understand what went wrong (search for \u0026ldquo;media-keys\u0026rdquo;). It\u0026rsquo;s likely that you had problems with the dynamic libraries in step 8 above.\n","permalink":"https://wrgms.com/fixing-gnome-3-2x-hardcoded-superf1-shortcut/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eUbuntu 18.04 LTS is finally out, and with it you now have Gnome out of the box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve been using Gnome for several years, and have enjoyed its minimalism.

You may smile. But it will come…” [Henry Ford, 1940]\nFlying cars are not something new. The idea has been going around since the 19th century, even before the very first flight by Santos-Dumont (or Wright Brothers, depending on your bias). But it was The Jetsons who first brought the concept of flying cars to the masses. We grew up dreaming that one day we\u0026rsquo;d be able to get in our cars and fly straight to our destination - fast, safely, and traffic-free.\nThanks to Moore\u0026rsquo;s Law and the latest advances in engineering, we may be closer to flying cars than you think.\nAeroMobil is an innovative company from Slovakia, founded by Štefan Klein and Juraj Vaculik. Štefan, a well-known designer for Audi, Volkswagen and BMW, has been pursuing this idea for more than two decades. Juraj has a long and successful track record in advertising and as an investor. The two minds came together to create the company and make the dream a reality.\nDuring his talk at SXSW today, Juraj talked about the latest advances and their recent flying prototypes. As you can see on the two videos below, they made quite a progress between version 2.5 (early 2013) and 3.0 (late 2014).\nAeroMobil 2.5:\nAeroMobil 3.0: (note that Štefan himself test drives every prototype. He believes no one understand the machines better than him)\nDespite the progress, don\u0026rsquo;t expect to be driving - err.. flying - just yet. There are still several roadblocks (no pun intended) before mass adoption. They still need to figure out logistical challenges, like fueling stations, or grass strips next to roads for landing and take off. And change legislations, and define new testing procedures and certification. Or get people certified as pilots (yeah, don\u0026rsquo;t think your driver\u0026rsquo;s license will fly).\nBut with Google investing so heavily in self-driving cars, and SpaceX sending rockets to space, it\u0026rsquo;s not hard to imagine these efforts converging and eventually giving birth to self-driving flying cars. It might sound crazy at first, but there\u0026rsquo;s a good chance we\u0026rsquo;ll see it in our lifetime. AeroMobil may be in the exact spot that Paul Graham calls a Frighteningly Ambitious Startup Idea.\nCrazy? Yes.

With 800+ sessions this year, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to get overwhelmed. But get over your FOMO, and enjoy the serendipity. You will miss many good sessions, and that\u0026rsquo;s OK. The best talk will be that one you didn\u0026rsquo;t plan, and just entered because your first option was full.\nSpeaking of crowded sessions: always have a plan B. Your first option will likely be full, so having a second/third option is always important.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t go to panels. Ever. There\u0026rsquo;s hardly enough time for one person to convey a good idea in under 60 minutes. 4 or 5 becomes a festival of shallow sound bites. You already have Twitter for those.\nSeek geeky and obscure talks. The less buzzwords on the description, the better. Extra points if the talk is by someone who is actually making things - rather than people talking about those who made it. I saw some unbelievably good sessions in the past which had less 20 participants in the audience.\nBring an extra battery pack. Your phone will die midday, even if you have an iPhone 6 Plus. Pack some extra juice.\nPlan your commute time between sessions. Some venues are 2 miles away from Austin Convention Center, and shuttles may take 15-30 min door-to-door. Try Lyft/Uber, or pedicabs. Or you can be ultra-hipster and apply for a loaner Boosted Board. I already secured mine!\nDriving is usually a bad idea. Parking is expensive, and you may want to have a beer or two (or six or ten). Get an Uber/Lyft, or use the official shuttles, but be prepared to spend one hour each way. And remind yourself next time to book your ticket the exact minute they go on sale, and enjoy the convenience of a hotel in walking distance.\nHave a good breakfast. You won\u0026rsquo;t eat much during the day, and you\u0026rsquo;re probably still recovering from last night.\nRSVPs are usually useless. Most of the parties don\u0026rsquo;t require RSVP, and use it just to collect email addresses. And the ones that do are not the ones you see on blogs. [EDIT: this used to be true, but it\u0026rsquo;s now starting to change. Many parties are now respecting RSVPs, and even many of the talks in the official program started to require reservation, so play safe and do your homework.]\nRemember: SXSW is a marathon, not a sprint. It\u0026rsquo;s 5 full days (double if you do Music/Film), so take time to enjoy yourself. It\u0026rsquo;s Spring, and there\u0026rsquo;s no better time to be in Austin.

The requirements are:\nMust be able to listen continuously Run on embedded ARM processors (particuarly Raspberry Pi and BeagleBone Black) Good accuracy on a limited set of words (English only) Decent performance, particularly on low-power CPUs My first thought was to use Google Speech API. The accuracy is great, and it\u0026rsquo;s reasonably fast. But it is also limited to only 50 calls per day, so it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t satisfy requirement #1. And I don\u0026rsquo;t like the idea of streaming all of my personal conversations to anyone. It\u0026rsquo;s already enough to have NSA listening to my phone calls\u0026hellip;\n(maybe it\u0026rsquo;s an option for the future, when implementing something with a physical push-button, like a Star Trek communicator device)\nSiriProxy is another neat hack, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work with iOS7/8 anymore. Apple will soon offer an official interface to Siri via its HomeKit program, but it\u0026rsquo;ll only work with licensed hardware. Likely not an option for hackers and personal projects.\nAfter some research, I found CMUSphinx project, which seems to be the best project in the area of voice recognition. PocketSphinx toolkit is the version you want for embedded CPUs, as it\u0026rsquo;s pure C, and rather portable.\nThe documentation is not very friendly, but once you get it going, it works well.\nThe first step is to download and install SphinxBase, followed by PocketSphinx. The README has instructions to compile and install, but it\u0026rsquo;s the basic\n./configure make make install By default it\u0026rsquo;ll install binaries to /usr/local/bin, and language models to /usr/local/share. Make sure you have swig and alsa drivers installed before starting (apt-get install swig alsa-base alsa-utils).\nOnce installed, you need to figure out which dictionary model you want to use. Just for testing, I created a dictionary with 106 words, based on the old Logo language (remember the Logo turtle?), like forward, backward, turn right, turn left, etc.\nBefore you can start training PocketSphinx, you\u0026rsquo;ll need an acoustic model. Sadly, the speech corpus (i.e., audio files with spoken words) used to train the models are usually closed source. So either you spend a couple of hours recording the voices (or using an4/Voxforge) to train your own model, or you\u0026rsquo;ll skip this entirely and just use some of the built-in models, accepting lower accuracy. Given my limited number of words in the dictionary, I decided to go with built in acoustic models.\nNext, you need to describe your Language Model - the words, grammar, and frequency of words that you want to recognize. This tutorial has more details. If you\u0026rsquo;re in a hurry and just want to get PocketSphinx going with a dictionary for your pre-defined words, save yourself some trouble and use the online lmtool. This webservice will allow you to upload your dictionary file (a simple ASCII file, with one sentence or word per line), and it\u0026rsquo;ll generate all the language models you need to run PocketSphinx.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a sample of my dictionary file:\nannounce answer ask back clipboard color copy count ... sentence set space square root stamp wait wait until when who word If you want to play with this dictionary, download these files here, and run:\npocketsphinx_continuous -lm lm/logo.lm -dict lm/logo.dic (note: if pocketsphinx is stuck at READY, it\u0026rsquo;s probably listening to the wrong hw device. Check where is the microphone attached via cat /proc/asound/cards, and add -adcdev plughw:X,0 to the line above, replacing X by the hardware id of your microphone).\npocketsphinx_continuous -lm lm/logo.lm -dict lm/logo.dic -adcdev plughw:2,0 Smartphones use all sorts of tricks to cancel the background noise, but that requires special hardware, so you\u0026rsquo;ll need a reasonable quiet environment. Otherwise the accuracy will suffer, depending on how large your dictionary is.\nAs you would expect, smaller dictionaries have much better accuracy. With a 100-word, I got 60-70% correct. After I reduced to a simple 15-words dictionary, I got virtually 100% match rate, even with some background noise and a non-American accent. Certainly enough for my projects.\nNext up: running this on a Raspberry Pi, installing a decent openair microphone, and testing overall performance when connected to a home automation system.

It\u0026rsquo;s a shame that Linux keyboard is still horribly broken by default (some may say it\u0026rsquo;s by design; no, it\u0026rsquo;s not).\nIt has been asked before, but most answers will point you to use xim, which will open another can of worms.

Some say it\u0026rsquo;ll the the digital renaissance; others claim it\u0026rsquo;s the best thing to ever happen to the web, after the browser itself.\nThis video summarizes well the sentiment:\nThis is wrong.\nTen years from now we\u0026rsquo;ll look back and realize how much the new gTLDs have hurt us.\nFirst, most of the new gTLDs add little or no value. I bet we could live another 50 years without a .ninja, a .soy, .fail, .florist, or .loans.\nOthers will proclaim that the new gTLDs are useful, and point to domains like .nyc, .london, or .website, as examples of the \u0026ldquo;democratization\u0026rdquo; promoted by the new categories.\nBut these will be the exception rather than the rule. In practice the new gTLDS will force brands to spend millions of dollars to protect against cybersquatters rushing to claim new brand-related domains, amongst other threats.\nBefore you had to register your brand across a handful of TLDs. Now you have 1,400 more to worry about. That\u0026rsquo;s like a whack-a-mole game, but you\u0026rsquo;re outnumbered by hundreds of moles for each hand you have.\nAnd yet, this is not my main concern. Brands got screwed and will spend a ton of money, while domain registrars will be laughing all the way to the bank. Whatever, life will be fine.\nMy concern is a different one: the new gTLDs will accelerate the demise of the URI.\nWe already lost users to search. It\u0026rsquo;s more convenient to type \u0026ldquo;Brand\u0026rdquo; on the browser and let your search engine do the rest than typing \u0026ldquo;brand.com\u0026rdquo;. And on mobile the URL is already hidden from the user, as if it were an irrelevant technical implementation detail. Same on Safari on desktop.\nBut now multiply this situation by thousands of gTLDs, and you\u0026rsquo;ll have the perfect Paradox of Choice. Is it a .com, a .net, .cc? Nops. Keep going friend.\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s add to the mix the fact that a) most of the mobile traffic is already coming from native apps, and b) Apple is pushing to bury the URI, and c) Google is replacing everything by its omni-search. And we\u0026rsquo;re not even talking about Siri or voice-activated search. This will result in a very different world. My prediction: thanks to the new gTLDs, mobile apps and commercial players will have even more control than today, and URLs will be demoted to second-class citizens. They will still be there, but buried somewhere in the sub-menus of your browser, or the API of your Chrome extensions. Just like IP addresses; you know it\u0026rsquo;s there somewhere, but nobody cares.\nIn the name of find-ability and ease of use, we\u0026rsquo;ll live in an URL-less world. And commercial entities will be rewarded and profit from your traffic.\nI\u0026rsquo;m sure that\u0026rsquo;s not the web that Sir Tim Berners-Lee envisioned 25 years ago.\n","permalink":"https://wrgms.com/gtlds-and-the-death-of-urls/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eUnless you\u0026rsquo;ve been living under a rock, you\u0026rsquo;ve read \u003cem\u003ead nauseum\u003c/em\u003e about the overly optimistic predictions for the new gTLDs.

Wrong.\nBut this time I was the one to blame.\nAfter solving the conflict with bash, I changed /etc/passwd user shell to /bin/bash. The only problem is that Synology wipes the system partition during firmware upgrades, so when I upgraded to DSM 4.1.2668, my custom `/bin/bash``was gone. Of course this locked me out of the system. No SSH, SCP or FTP. Great.\nAfter a few moments of panic, I remembered I still had the serial console. So I could put Linux in single user mode, and drop into recovery mode.\nSo if you\u0026rsquo;re ever in a similar situation, here\u0026rsquo;s how to fix it:\n1. First, you need a serial console.\n2. During U-Boot, press any key to cancel the automatic kernel boot (Hit any key to stop autoboot).\n3. Enter printenv to check the environment variables. Search for bootargs and bootm variables (they will be different on your system, so do NOT copy and paste from mine, unless you have a Synology DS212+ with the same DSM).\n4. Append reboot=cold,hard emergency init=/bin/sh to the end of bootargs variable. In my case, this is what I used:\nsetenv bootargs \u0026#39;console=ttyS0,115200 ip=off initrd=0x00800040,4M root=/dev/md0 rw syno_hw_version=DS212pv20 ihd_num=2 netif_num=1 esata_7042=1 reboot=cold,hard emergency init=/bin/sh\u0026#39; (again, your parameters will likely be different, so don\u0026rsquo;t copy and paste)\n5. Boot your kernel, with\nbootm F8080000 F8280000 Now your Synology should be happily botting in single user mode, ignoring /etc/passwd and dropping you to a plain shell. Do what you have to do to fix the system, and reboot.\nYou can also use these steps to recover your system partition from a crash or other problem.\n","permalink":"https://wrgms.com/entering-single-user-mode-on-a-synology/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/content/images/2013/01/synology.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"alt text\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/content/images/2013/01/synology.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hope this will be my last post about Synology for a while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter dealing for a few weeks with an \u003ca href=\"http://forum.synology.com/enu/viewtopic.php?f=221\u0026amp;t=59808\u0026amp;start=45#p232455\"\u003eunstable environment\u003c/a\u003e, then \u003ca href=\"/recovering-a-failed-synology-diskstation-ds2xx-serial\"\u003ehacking a serial console\u003c/a\u003e to troubleshoot, then \u003ca href=\"/synologys-secret-telnet-password/\"\u003ecracking the secret recovery telnet password\u003c/a\u003e just for fun, and finally solving the \u003ca href=\"http://serverfault.com/questions/458553/cant-log-in-via-ssh-to-any-accounts-set-to-use-bin-bash-as-a-default-shell/\"\u003eweird mistery\u003c/a\u003e of SSH \u003ca href=\"/reverse-engineering-synology-openssh\"\u003enot accepting /bin/bash as default shell\u003c/a\u003e, I thought I finally had a stable environment.

Maybe /etc/shells? Nops. Maybe sshd_config? No. PAM modules, then? Also not. I even tried compiling bash from source (which took me a full day, just to get ARM GCC to cross compile properly).

The user has to be called \u0026ldquo;root\u0026rdquo;.\nWHAAAT?\nThankfully, Synology uses a modified Linux distribution, so they publish the code under GPL.\nAfter a couple of hours looking at the OpenSSH source code, things became pretty obvious. Here\u0026rsquo;s the piece of code from their version of OpenSSH 5.8p1, file session.c:\nvoid do_child(Session *s, const char *command) { ... #ifdef MY_ABC_HERE char szValue[8]; int RunSSH = 0; SSH_CMD SSHCmd = REQ_UNKNOWN; if (1 == GetKeyValue(\u0026#34;/etc/synoinfo.conf\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;runssh\u0026#34;, szValue, sizeof(szValue))) { if (strcasecmp(szValue, \u0026#34;yes\u0026#34;) == 0) { RunSSH = 1; } } if (IsSFTPReq(command)){ SSHCmd = REQ_SFTP; } else if (IsRsyncReq(command)){ SSHCmd = REQ_RSYNC; } else if (IsTimebkpRequest(command)){ SSHCmd = REQ_TIMEBKP; } else if (RunSSH \u0026amp;amp;\u0026amp;amp; IsAllowShell(pw)){ SSHCmd = REQ_SHELL; } else { goto Err; } if (REQ_RSYNC == SSHCmd) { pw = SYNOChgValForRsync(pw); } if (!SSHCanLogin(SSHCmd, pw)) { goto Err; } goto Pass; Err: fprintf(stderr, \u0026#34;Permission denied, please try again.\\n\u0026#34;); exit(1); Pass: #endif /* MY_ABC_HERE */ ... } And here is the IsAllowShell(pw):\nstatic int IsAllowShell(const struct passwd *pw) { struct passwd *pUnPrivilege = NULL; char *szUserName = NULL; if (!pw || !pw-\u0026amp;gt;pw_name) { return 0; } szUserName = pw-\u0026amp;gt;pw_name; if(!strcmp(szUserName, \u0026#34;root\u0026#34;) || !strcmp(szUserName, \u0026#34;admin\u0026#34;)){ return 1; } if (NULL != (pUnPrivilege = getpwnam(szUserName))){ if (!strcmp(pUnPrivilege-\u0026amp;gt;pw_shell, \u0026#34;/bin/sh\u0026#34;) || !strcmp(pUnPrivilege-\u0026amp;gt;pw_shell, \u0026#34;/bin/ash\u0026#34;)) { return 1; } } return 0; } Basically synology created a heavily customized version of OpenSSH, including a handful of hacks - e.g., additional checking before accepting a login to see if the SSH service is enabled within the web interface, or stripping special chars (;, |, \u0026lsquo;) from rsync commands, and\u0026hellip; wait for it\u0026hellip; blocking anyone other than root or admin from using any shell other than /bin/sh or /bin/ash.\nOnce identified the cause, the fix was easy: just remove the call to IsAllowShell(). Cross-compile, upload to the NAS, reboot and voilà, regular users can now use bash normally.\nThe hardest part was to get cross-compiling working properly.

Or you simply don\u0026rsquo;t like the idea of having your port 23 open to the world for god-knows-how-long until a Synology tech support can look into your case.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ve probably tried telneting to your NAS. Maybe you\u0026rsquo;ve even tried opening the case and hacking the serial port, only to discover that you don\u0026rsquo;t have the root password. The DS Assistant password doesn\u0026rsquo;t work, and you exhausted all obvious guesses - blank, synopass, synology, password, admin, root, etc.\nWell, what about c12-0804? No, I didn\u0026rsquo;t make this up. This is today\u0026rsquo;s password.\nBut if you\u0026rsquo;re reading this a few days (or years) from now, too bad; it won\u0026rsquo;t work. Unless, of course, you wait until December 8th. Because the password repeats every year.\nBasically Synology hardcoded a modified login binary within the firmware that accepts an obfuscated password for root, which depends on the current date. (by the way, this isn\u0026rsquo;t the only thing Synology folks hardcoded in the firmware).\nThanks to GPL, Synology was forced to publish the original source code for the firmware. Based on the original correct_password.c code, I hacked a short snippet to generate the daily password.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the Synology Telnet password generator:\n#include \u0026amp;lt;stdlib.h\u0026amp;gt; #include \u0026amp;lt;time.h\u0026amp;gt; #include \u0026amp;lt;stdio.h\u0026amp;gt; void main() { struct timeval tvTime; struct tm tmOutput; gettimeofday(\u0026amp;amp;tvTime, 0); localtime_r(\u0026amp;amp;(tvTime.tv_sec), \u0026amp;amp;tmOutput); tmOutput.tm_mon += 1; printf(\u0026#34;password for today is: %x%02d-%02x%02d\\n\\n\u0026#34;, tmOutput.tm_mon, tmOutput.tm_mon, tmOutput.tm_mday, gcd(tmOutput.tm_mon, tmOutput.tm_mday)); } int gcd(int a, int b) { return (b?gcd(b,a%b):a); } Compile and run the code above with gcc. You can also use the excellent Codepad Repl.it to run the code online and get the password for today (no registration needed).\nBonus tip: if you\u0026rsquo;re curious how exactly the password is generated, here\u0026rsquo;s the algorithm:\n1st character = month in hexadecimal, lower case (1=Jan, \u0026hellip; , a=Oct, b=Nov, c=Dec) 2-3 = month in decimal, zero padded and starting in 1 (01, 02, 03, \u0026hellip;, 11, 12) 4 = dash 5-6 = day of the month in hex (01, 02 .., 0A, .., 1F) 7-8 = greatest common divisor between month and day, zero padded. This is always a number between 01 and 12. So, let\u0026rsquo;s say today is October 15, the password would be: a10-0f05 where a = month in hex, 10 = month in decimal, 0f = day in hex, 05 = greatest divisor between 10 and 15).\nIf you have trouble calculating the greatest common divisor (elementary math, anyone?), Wolfram Alpha is your friend.\nThis was tested on a Synology DS212+, with Marvell Kirkwood mv6282 chipset. It\u0026rsquo;s unlikely but still possible that different models use a different algorithm. YMMV, so always check the source code.\n[UPDATE 1: Several users reported that this works in many other models, including DS409, DS112j, etc. Please leave a comment with your model and firmware version.]\n[UPDATE 2: If it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work, it\u0026rsquo;s probably that your date is incorrect in the NAS. Per Patrick\u0026rsquo;s suggestion in the comments below, try \u0026ldquo;101-0101\u0026rdquo;, which is the password for Jan 01]\n","permalink":"https://wrgms.com/synologys-secret-telnet-password/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIf you have a Synology NAS and had some sort of disk crash in the past, you\u0026rsquo;ve probably encountered the famous \u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;Cannot format system partition\u0026rdquo;\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;Please configure your router to forward port 23 to DiskStation and contact Synology online support\u0026rdquo;\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, it sucks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt sucks even more when you know the disk is perfectly fine, and you still have hopes to recover your data.

The software is robust and much better than my old DroboFS, and the fact that it is entirely open source is a big plus.\nI recently upgraded the firmware to DSM 2661. Everything worked fine. For 12 hours. The next morning, the device was dead, with the blue blink of death).\nWas it the new firmware? Or maybe a disk crash? Who knows.\nI followed the basic tests recommended by Synology: remove both disks, turn it on and wait 30s for a long beep. Beeeeeep. Great, the motherboard is still functional. It also responded to ping and showed up on DS Assistant, so processor and ethernet are also working fine.\nThe Synology DS NAS is basically an embedded Linux box, using md + lvm for RAID. Nothing is proprietary, so I mounted the disks on my Linux desktop and spent a few more hours cloning and re-building the RAID using a spare disk. Life is good.\nTill\u0026hellip; it crashed again.\nThere was something wrong with the system partition, so I wanted to see inside the NAS, before the kernel finishes booting.\nThankfully, Synology folks already put a physical serial port in there. It\u0026rsquo;s not documented, but it\u0026rsquo;s not hard to find. You just have to open the case.\nDisclaimer: make sure you have backup! I am not responsible if you lose your data, void your warranty, burn down your house or kill your dog.\nStart by opening the case. Here\u0026rsquo;s a video with instructions [update: the original video is not available anymore, but here\u0026rsquo;s a similar one]. Be aware this may break the small internal hooks, and you\u0026rsquo;ll need to use tape or hot glue to put it back together (what\u0026rsquo;s wrong with manufacturers these days? What\u0026rsquo;s the problem with good old screws?) Inside the case, look for a 6-pin header, normally labeled JP2 (or COM1 on older models). The pins likely are: Pin Number Function Confirmed on Synology DS212+ \u0026nbsp; 13.3V 2GND 4TX 6RX Now connect the pins 2, 4 and 6 (respectively GNS, TX, RX) to your USB-TTL 3v3 cable (if using the FTDI cable from Adafruit, it\u0026rsquo;ll be 1-black, 5-yellow, 4-orange. Make sure you don\u0026rsquo;t short-circuit any of the pins. These male-female jumper wires could be useful. Open your preferred terminal program (under Win ExtraPutty is the best in town), set to 115200, disable xon/xoff, and you\u0026rsquo;re all set. Now you can turn on your DS, and see all the beauty of what\u0026rsquo;s going on under the hood:\n__ __ _ _ | \\/ | __ _ _ ____ _____| | | | |\\/| |/ _` | \u0026#39;__\\ \\ / / _ \\ | | | | | | (_| | | \\ V / __/ | | |_| |_|\\__,_|_| \\_/ \\___|_|_| _ _ ____ _ | | | | | __ ) ___ ___ | |_ | | | |___| _ \\ / _ \\ / _ \\| __| | |_| |___| |_) | (_) | (_) | |_ \\___/ |____/ \\___/ \\___/ \\__| ** LOADER ** ** MARVELL BOARD: Synology Disk Station LE U-Boot 1.1.4 (Dec 2 2011 - 15:56:02) Marvell version: 3.5.9 U-Boot code: 00600000 -\u0026amp;gt; 0067FFF0 BSS: -\u0026amp;gt; 0068B3D4 Soc: 88F6282 A1CPU running @ 2000Mhz L2 running @ 500Mhz SysClock = 500Mhz , TClock = 200Mhz DRAM (DDR3) CAS Latency = 7 tRP = 7 tRAS = 20 tRCD=7 DRAM CS[0] base 0x00000000 size 256MB DRAM CS[1] base 0x10000000 size 256MB DRAM Total size 512MB 16bit width Addresses 8M - 0M are saved for the U-Boot usage.

It\u0026rsquo;s sad to see so much work and love going nowhere. At least they were classy and wrote a candid and honest shutting-down post, and they\u0026rsquo;re even refunding users (!). That\u0026rsquo;s a level of integrity that you don\u0026rsquo;t see everyday in the startup world.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;ve never played Glitch, it\u0026rsquo;s now too late. The game world is now restricted to existing users, and everything will shut down on December 9th 2012. Here\u0026rsquo;s some videos to give you an idea of what you missed.\nI was part of the first wave of beta testers. Even though I\u0026rsquo;ve never spent much time playing, I remember how every detail was carefullyt thought through, and painstakenly executed. The videos don\u0026rsquo;t do justice to their attention to detail.\nBut, aside from the intrinsic beauty, the gameplay was dull. It was just a cute massive multiplayer social game. Maybe the cutest ever. But without a strong storytelling or any of the gamification tactics from other social gaming companies, there was no reason for you to keep coming back.\nIn a world of \u0026ldquo;Your crops are dying! Your friend Samantha just moved to a farm next door. Invite your friends to level up faster.\u0026rdquo;, it\u0026rsquo;s hard to keep users engaged these days.\nThis reminds me of the Steve Blank\u0026rsquo;s MVP stories. Do you need to develop a full game, with so many levels, intricate dialogues, dozens of non-playable characters, only to realize that your users aren\u0026rsquo;t coming back in the first place?\nCan\u0026rsquo;t you create a demo with a couple of levels and a handful of hard-coded NPCs, and invite your mom/sister/significant other to play? Just check how many times they come back (when you\u0026rsquo;re not looking). You\u0026rsquo;ll achieve the same conclusions, with 10% of the effort.\nOf course hindsight is a bitch \u0026ndash; or, like someone said on HN: \u0026quot;\u0026hellip;hindsight is a Glitch\u0026quot; :). Sometimes you can\u0026rsquo;t just hack an MVP together; you need a fully polished product. But I don\u0026rsquo;t think that\u0026rsquo;s the case here.\nIt seems to me they put too much effort on having a full product, and lost sight of the bigger picture. They repeated some of the same fatal mistakes others have done. For example, Lessons from Habitat outlines many of the same pitfalls, as seen by the creators of Lucasfilm in the mid-80\u0026rsquo;s. The entire paper is a great read, but one part that strikes me as relevant to this discussion:\n\u0026ldquo;While we find much of the work presently being done on elaborate interface technologies \u0026ndash; DataGloves, head-mounted displays, special-purpose rendering engines, and so on \u0026ndash; both exciting and promising, the almost mystical euphoria that currently seems to surround all this hardware is, in our opinion, both excessive and somewhat misplaced.\nWe can\u0026rsquo;t help having a nagging sense that it\u0026rsquo;s all a bit of a distraction from the really pressing issues.\n*At the core of our vision is the idea that cyberspace is necessarily a multiple-participant environment. It seems to us that the things that are important to the inhabitants of such an environment are the capabilities available to them, the characteristics of the other people they encounter there, and the ways these various participants can affect one another.\nBeyond a foundation set of communications capabilities, the details of the technology used to present this environment to its participants, while sexy and interesting, are of relatively peripheral concern.\u0026rdquo;\nKeep in mind the first Habitat was launched in 1986, almost 30 years ago, and ran in 64Kb on a Commodore64.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re now spoiled by Call Of Duty and hyper-realist NBA games. But there\u0026rsquo;s a point to be made that the success of an MMO game is not defined by its level of peripheral sophistication (be it design, cuteness, or head-mounted displays), but by the social experience, and how people interact with each other. Minecraft, with its blocky graphics and limited interactivity, is a prime example.\nGlitch isn\u0026rsquo;t alone in repeating these mistakes. Worlds Chat did the same two decades ago, being the first 3D world ever created. It was later replaced by The Palace. Later Philip Rosedale had his chance with Second Life, which exploded, then burst, and now is becoming cool again (and Philip is trying his hand again with High Fidelity).\nAnother issue with Glitch was its channel distribution. It\u0026rsquo;s challenging in 2012 to succeed with a web-only game, especially if you\u0026rsquo;re not anchored on Facebook. And Glitch was built in Flash (!), so it missed billions of 2-3 minutes slots of free time that people have when waiting for the train, bathroom, elevator.

Sony. HBGary Hack. FBI. Paypal, Visa \u0026amp; MasterCard. Mubarak. Occupy Wall Street. SOPA/PIPA.\nAnonymous has been busy for the past few years. It started as juvenile pranks on 4chan\u0026rsquo;s boards, but grew and became a powerful mechanism against oppressive governments and unscrupulous corporations.\nIts trajectory was beautifully captured in the documentary \u0026ldquo;We Are Legion: The Story of the Hacktivists\u0026rdquo;, that will be released later this year. I had the pleasure to watch the premiere in Austin during SXSW, and I must say - it\u0026rsquo;s f..ing brilliant. The movie is still in post-production, so the theatrical release may be slightly different.\nWe also participated in an exclusive interview with the film director \u0026ldquo;Brian Knappenberger\u0026rdquo;, who was joined on stage by former Anonymous member Gregg Housh and two special guests Anon behind masks: one from Austin, and another just called Anonymous9000, connecting via Skype from an undisclosed location (and using a robotic voice changer). It was a surreal experience.\nTogether they gave a passionate and fascinating perspective of the evolution of Anonymous, its internal workings, and the journey since 4Chan to the present day. They discussed how the group went after the Church of Scientology, why they hacked HBGary, discussed the release of confidential data of Sony customers, and how lately they\u0026rsquo;ve started to engage in social movements around freedom, Occupy Wall Street, the Arab Spring, and the support to Wikileaks\u0026rsquo; founder, Julian Assange.\nA few highlights of the session, in no particular order:\nsome Anons don\u0026rsquo;t agree with the dump of personal information (like in Sony\u0026rsquo;s case). But a few radical sub-groups - like Lulzsec - have a different opinion, and believe the press only pays attention when something concrete happens. Ironically, one of the most vocal supporters of dumping personal data was Sabu - which was revealed last week to be an FBI informant since June 2011. Conflict of interest, maybe?\nAnons in general don\u0026rsquo;t support attacking the press, as they believe in freedom of expression themselves (even when it is press against Anonymous). Some may disagree. Others simply don\u0026rsquo;t care; they\u0026rsquo;re in for the lulz, and accuse others of being moralfags. It\u0026rsquo;s these constant disagreements within Anonymous\u0026rsquo; anarchic structure that gave birth to dissidents, like Lulzsec.\n\u0026ldquo;Thousands of twenty-something socially awkward nerds got laid for the first time due to these movements and events in real life. Behind a mask, they all felt more comfortable in expressing themselves and talking with girls. We saw several marriages between Anons that met while protesting against the Church of Scientology and others\u0026rdquo;.\n\u0026ldquo;The DDoS attacks have just one objective: attract press. Whenever we have a message that we want the press to distribute, we DDoS someone so the press will publish the news that Anonymous attacked again, followed by what we wanted them to communicate. Otherwise we\u0026rsquo;d be just ignored. Look at SOPA/PIPA; we\u0026rsquo;ve been talking about this for years, and no one ever cared. Then we DDoS\u0026rsquo;d RIAA/MPAA/DoJ websites\u0026hellip; and the press showed up in full force overnight.\u0026rdquo;\nWatch the trailer here [YouTube].\nUpdate 2012-11-17: now also available for rental on Vimeo. This is the first time that Vimeo does movie rental. EDIT: Vimeo link is broken, but as of May 2025 it is now available on YouTube.\nUpdate 2012-10-17: it is opening in theatres this weekend. NY, LA, Houston, Canada, Rio de Janeiro and others. Check to see if your city is in the list. You can also pre-order the movie, starting on 10/30.

If you\u0026rsquo;re not one of the 12,000 people already using the service (that\u0026rsquo;s the number Andrea gave during the talk), well\u0026hellip; you should give it a try, because everyone is talking about it. Yeah, I live in the echo chamber, I know.\nGlancee, like its competitors Highlight, Sonar, Banjo, are all exploring the new niche of location social discovery - some sort of Match.com-meets-LinkedIn. Unproven territory, but sounds promising (albeit somewhat dystopian) to me. Andrea spoke about the current status of social discovery apps and the different approaches taken by each player. He also mentioned the incredible growth (hard to see 12,000 as incredible, but startup founders have to drink their own Kool-Aid), particularly with all the buzz around SXSW.\nBut to me the most interesting tidbit was the concept of monetizing the service via Spatial Analysis.\nHe didn\u0026rsquo;t elaborate much, so let me speculate a bit here. Consider that you have a device on your pocket that is connected to Facebook (i.e. knows everything about your attitudinal behavior - including Likes, affinity with brands, reach, friends). You have Glancee installed, and as such it is constantly broadcasting your current geolocation. Every. Single. Minute. Like Google Latitude, but with a Facebook social layer on top of it.\nNot only it knows who you are and what you like, but also where you\u0026rsquo;ve been, where you work, live, play, study, shop, your the preferred gas station, and countries you\u0026rsquo;ve travelled.\nAll this leads to a level of geospatial analysis never seen before, using all your social graph as an extra dimension. You could plot heatmaps showing location of people that liked your brand on FB, and use to optimize out-of-home media placement. Or monitor the consumers of a competitor brand when planning new physical stores. Basically it\u0026rsquo;s any marketer\u0026rsquo;s dream come true.\nOf course, it has just one small problem: it needs permission, and critical mass. You need tens of millions of users using the service, in order to have a meaningful representation.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why Andreas was so adamant when I asked him about his number one goal: \u0026ldquo;Growth. And fast\u0026rdquo;.\nUpdate 2012-05-04: it seems Facebook may agree with me here \u0026ndash; Facebook just announced they\u0026rsquo;re acquiring Glancee. I guess Andrea can scratch off \u0026ldquo;Growth\u0026rdquo; from his list.\n","permalink":"https://wrgms.com/glancee/","summary":"\u003ccenter\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Glancee at SXSW\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/content/images/2014/Feb/glancee.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/center\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy last session of SXSW Day 2 was with \u003ca href=\"http://andreavaccari.com/\"\u003eAndrea Vaccari\u003c/a\u003e, the CEO of the trendy location-based discovery startup \u003ca href=\"http://www.glancee.com/\"\u003eGlancee\u003c/a\u003e.

But despite recent progress with Content Network and YouTube, the marketing community still see the search giant as a way to drive conversion at the bottom of the funnel. In order to move to the next level, Google has to prove they can create emotional connections with consumers.\nEnter Project Re:Brief, just announced during SXSW.\nAccording to Aman Govil, Google\u0026rsquo;s Product Marketing Manager, the idea was to \u0026ldquo;re-imagine iconic campaigns of 4 classic global brands through the lenses of modern technology\u0026rdquo;. The project aims to be a benchmark of what is possible when you have the right idea and the perfect balance between creativity \u0026amp; technology.\nThe brands were carefully selected: Coca-Cola with Hilltop, Volvo with Drive it like you hate it, Avis We try harder, and Alka-Seltzer I can\u0026rsquo;t believe I ate the whole thing. The secret sauce was that they brought back from retirement the original creators of these 4 campaigns, and paired them with digital creatives, so they could re-imagine their original creations, leveraging today\u0026rsquo;s technology.\nIt was fascinating to see people like Harvey Gabor (Coca-Cola\u0026rsquo;s Hilltop, 1971) working with a bunch of twenty-something, and discovering how to use touch screens, mobile, realtime web.\nI had the opportunity to chat with Aman and Drew (the global creative director for the new campaigns) to understand how they pulled it together. Surprisingly, each project took just 2-3 months, and were executed with a relatively small budget (\u0026ldquo;Less than a TV spots\u0026rdquo;, told me Drew). Seems the advertisers were initially resistant to touch iconic pieces like Hilltop, but eventually understood the spirit of the project, and loved the opportunity to work with the original creators.\nWhat is even more fascinating is that not a single can of Coke or Alka-Seltzer was sold because this initiative. Google pulled this off not to help their clients sell more, but to help themseves. The target audience was marketers and agencies, hoping they would talk, comment, write blog posts. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t get more meta than this.\nCheck out more at www.projectrebrief.com, and look for the documentary later this year.\nUpdate 2012-06-22: the full documentary is now available on YouTube.\n","permalink":"https://wrgms.com/rebrief/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/content/images/2014/Feb/google_rebrief-1.png\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the past years Google has been trying to go beyond search, diversifying their revenue sources.

It took me some time to make it work like I wanted (keyboard, extensions, application menu, etc), but I\u0026rsquo;m quite happy with everything. Or almost everything.\nOne thing I enjoyed over the years was the ability to customize my keyboard shortcuts. I have dozens of shotcuts - to center windows on my screen, to open programs, start and stop Spotify, to run macros, to log in to my remote servers, and so on.\nOne of my handy shortcuts is \u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;F1\u0026gt; to open an xterm with superuser, and \u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;F2\u0026gt; for regular user. I use custom xterm profiles, so I can easily check if I\u0026rsquo;m running under a privileged context by looking at the color of the window.\nThis worked well for years under Ubuntu 14.04 and Gnome 3.20, but stopped working with the upgrade to Bionic Beaver. More specifically, \u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;F1\u0026gt; is now System Help, with no way to change it.\n\u0026ldquo;No problem\u0026rdquo;, I thought; this can be easily adjusted in System Settings.\nNops.\nI searched around, and found other folks with the same problem, but no solution.\nI then decided to dug into the source code, and discovered the improbable: Gnome devs decided the help was so important that it deserved its own unique, hardcoded, and immutable shortcut. If you want to reassign it, you\u0026rsquo;re out of luck.\nAccording to gnome-settings-daemon changelog:\n=============== Version 3.21.90 =============== ... Media keys: - Add Super+F1 as a hardcoded shortcut for launching Help ... REALLY? What\u0026rsquo;s wrong with a default icon in the toolbar, or maybe a popup window when you boot for the first time? Also, does anyone really care about reading the basic documentation for\u0026hellip; a windows manager?\nI wasn\u0026rsquo;t convinced yet, but a closer look at the source code confirmed my fear: there it was: (file /gnome-settings-daemon/blob/master/plugins/media-keys/shortcuts-list.h):\n{ HELP_KEY, NULL, N_(\u0026#34;Help\u0026#34;), \u0026#34;\u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;F1\u0026#34;, GSD_ACTION_MODE_LAUNCHER }, So if you\u0026rsquo;re really determined to regain control of your \u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;F1\u0026gt;, there\u0026rsquo;s only one solution: to recompile gnome-settings-daemon, and replace the gsd-media-keys plugin. Spoiler alert: I\u0026rsquo;m glad to report that my patch was successful, but beware: getting the right dependencies and recompiling Gnome is not an easy feat. Keep reading if you\u0026rsquo;re interested in doing the same:\nDownload and install Gnome Builder Click on \u0026ldquo;Clone\u0026rdquo;, select a local directory (e.g., ~/Projects/) and use the official repo at https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-settings-daemon Open xterm, and enter cd ~/Projects/gnome-settings-daemon; git checkout tags/GNOME_SETTINGS_DAEMON_3_28_1 (you can check your exact version with gnome-shell --version. Check all tags available with git tag -l) Install all dependencies. These were the ones missing in my system, but YMMV: apt install libcolord-dev \\ libgeocode-glib-dev \\ gnome-desktop3-data \\ libgnome-desktop-3-dev \\ libgweather-3-dev \\ libcanberra-gtk3-dev \\ libgeoclue-2-dev \\ libnotify-dev \\ libpulse-mainloop-glib0 \\ libpulse-dev \\ gobject-introspection \\ libupower-glib-dev \\ libpolkit-gobject-1-dev \\ libasound2-dev \\ libgudev-1.0-dev \\ libwacom-dev \\ libnss3-dev \\ libcups2-dev \\ libnm-dev Patch the source code by editing ~/Projects/gnome-settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/shortcuts-list.h, and add a comment in front of the offender, like below (for Gnome 3.28.1 it is in line 69): // disabled! // { HELP_KEY, NULL, N_(\u0026#34;Help\u0026#34;), \u0026#34;\u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;F1\u0026#34;, GSD_ACTION_MODE_LAUNCHER }, Click [Rebuild] button in the Builder UI to compile (note: you need to click Rebuild, and not Build). You may want to turn off the deprecation warnings by editing meson.build and adding '-Wno-deprecated-declarations' to test_cflags = [...]; (line 70). If you installed all the dependencies correctly, you should have no warnings nor errors. Find the compiled binaries. You\u0026rsquo;re looking specifically for the plugin gsd-media-keys, so it\u0026rsquo;ll likely be in the directory ~/.var/app/org.gnome.Builder/cache/gnome-builder/projects/gnome-settings-daemon/builds/default-host-HEAD/plugins/media-keys cd ~/.var/app/org.gnome.Builder/cache/gnome-builder/projects/gnome-settings-daemon/builds/default-host-HEAD/plugins/media-keys ~ cp ./gsd-media-keys ~/gsd-media-keys.patched Before proceeding, you may want to inspect your binary to confirm it successfully linked with shared libraries by using ldd ~/gsd-media-keys.patched. In my case I had problems finding libgsd.so, so I solved it by adding the path to ldconfig (although the correct solution would be to fix this in the build system): sudo sh -c \u0026#39;echo \u0026#34;# gnome-settings-daemon\\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gnome-settings-daemon-3.0/\\n\u0026#34; \u0026gt; /etc/ld.so.conf.d/gnome-settings-daemon.conf\u0026#39; sudo ldconfig You\u0026rsquo;re now ready to install the patched gsd-media-keys binary in your system: cd /usr/lib/gnome-settings-daemon/ sudo mv ~/gsd-media-keys.patched . sudo strip -s ./gsd-media-keys.patched sudo mv gsd-media-keys gsd-media-keys.orig sudo ln -s gsd-media-keys.patched gsd-media-keys Log out or reboot, and you\u0026rsquo;re done! If all goes well, your system now should be running the gsd-media-keys plugin without the \u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;F1\u0026gt; hardcoded, so you can reassign to anything you like.\nIf anything goes wrong and you can\u0026rsquo;t log in, don\u0026rsquo;t despair. Simply open a console terminal by using \u0026lt;Ctrl\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;Alt\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;F2\u0026gt; and restore your original gsd-media-keys binary by doing:\ncd /usr/lib/gnome-settings-daemon/ sudo rm gsd-media-keys sudo ln -s gsd-media-keys.orig gsd-media-keys Use \u0026lt;Ctrl\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;Alt\u0026gt;\u0026lt;F1\u0026gt; to go back to Gnome and log in again. You can then inspect /var/log/syslog to understand what went wrong (search for \u0026ldquo;media-keys\u0026rdquo;). It\u0026rsquo;s likely that you had problems with the dynamic libraries in step 8 above.\n","permalink":"https://wrgms.com/fixing-gnome-3-2x-hardcoded-superf1-shortcut/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eUbuntu 18.04 LTS is finally out, and with it you now have Gnome out of the box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve been using Gnome for several years, and have enjoyed its minimalism.

You may smile. But it will come…” [Henry Ford, 1940]\nFlying cars are not something new. The idea has been going around since the 19th century, even before the very first flight by Santos-Dumont (or Wright Brothers, depending on your bias). But it was The Jetsons who first brought the concept of flying cars to the masses. We grew up dreaming that one day we\u0026rsquo;d be able to get in our cars and fly straight to our destination - fast, safely, and traffic-free.\nThanks to Moore\u0026rsquo;s Law and the latest advances in engineering, we may be closer to flying cars than you think.\nAeroMobil is an innovative company from Slovakia, founded by Štefan Klein and Juraj Vaculik. Štefan, a well-known designer for Audi, Volkswagen and BMW, has been pursuing this idea for more than two decades. Juraj has a long and successful track record in advertising and as an investor. The two minds came together to create the company and make the dream a reality.\nDuring his talk at SXSW today, Juraj talked about the latest advances and their recent flying prototypes. As you can see on the two videos below, they made quite a progress between version 2.5 (early 2013) and 3.0 (late 2014).\nAeroMobil 2.5:\nAeroMobil 3.0: (note that Štefan himself test drives every prototype. He believes no one understand the machines better than him)\nDespite the progress, don\u0026rsquo;t expect to be driving - err.. flying - just yet. There are still several roadblocks (no pun intended) before mass adoption. They still need to figure out logistical challenges, like fueling stations, or grass strips next to roads for landing and take off. And change legislations, and define new testing procedures and certification. Or get people certified as pilots (yeah, don\u0026rsquo;t think your driver\u0026rsquo;s license will fly).\nBut with Google investing so heavily in self-driving cars, and SpaceX sending rockets to space, it\u0026rsquo;s not hard to imagine these efforts converging and eventually giving birth to self-driving flying cars. It might sound crazy at first, but there\u0026rsquo;s a good chance we\u0026rsquo;ll see it in our lifetime. AeroMobil may be in the exact spot that Paul Graham calls a Frighteningly Ambitious Startup Idea.\nCrazy? Yes.

With 800+ sessions this year, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to get overwhelmed. But get over your FOMO, and enjoy the serendipity. You will miss many good sessions, and that\u0026rsquo;s OK. The best talk will be that one you didn\u0026rsquo;t plan, and just entered because your first option was full.\nSpeaking of crowded sessions: always have a plan B. Your first option will likely be full, so having a second/third option is always important.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t go to panels. Ever. There\u0026rsquo;s hardly enough time for one person to convey a good idea in under 60 minutes. 4 or 5 becomes a festival of shallow sound bites. You already have Twitter for those.\nSeek geeky and obscure talks. The less buzzwords on the description, the better. Extra points if the talk is by someone who is actually making things - rather than people talking about those who made it. I saw some unbelievably good sessions in the past which had less 20 participants in the audience.\nBring an extra battery pack. Your phone will die midday, even if you have an iPhone 6 Plus. Pack some extra juice.\nPlan your commute time between sessions. Some venues are 2 miles away from Austin Convention Center, and shuttles may take 15-30 min door-to-door. Try Lyft/Uber, or pedicabs. Or you can be ultra-hipster and apply for a loaner Boosted Board. I already secured mine!\nDriving is usually a bad idea. Parking is expensive, and you may want to have a beer or two (or six or ten). Get an Uber/Lyft, or use the official shuttles, but be prepared to spend one hour each way. And remind yourself next time to book your ticket the exact minute they go on sale, and enjoy the convenience of a hotel in walking distance.\nHave a good breakfast. You won\u0026rsquo;t eat much during the day, and you\u0026rsquo;re probably still recovering from last night.\nRSVPs are usually useless. Most of the parties don\u0026rsquo;t require RSVP, and use it just to collect email addresses. And the ones that do are not the ones you see on blogs. [EDIT: this used to be true, but it\u0026rsquo;s now starting to change. Many parties are now respecting RSVPs, and even many of the talks in the official program started to require reservation, so play safe and do your homework.]\nRemember: SXSW is a marathon, not a sprint. It\u0026rsquo;s 5 full days (double if you do Music/Film), so take time to enjoy yourself. It\u0026rsquo;s Spring, and there\u0026rsquo;s no better time to be in Austin.

The requirements are:\nMust be able to listen continuously Run on embedded ARM processors (particuarly Raspberry Pi and BeagleBone Black) Good accuracy on a limited set of words (English only) Decent performance, particularly on low-power CPUs My first thought was to use Google Speech API. The accuracy is great, and it\u0026rsquo;s reasonably fast. But it is also limited to only 50 calls per day, so it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t satisfy requirement #1. And I don\u0026rsquo;t like the idea of streaming all of my personal conversations to anyone. It\u0026rsquo;s already enough to have NSA listening to my phone calls\u0026hellip;\n(maybe it\u0026rsquo;s an option for the future, when implementing something with a physical push-button, like a Star Trek communicator device)\nSiriProxy is another neat hack, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work with iOS7/8 anymore. Apple will soon offer an official interface to Siri via its HomeKit program, but it\u0026rsquo;ll only work with licensed hardware. Likely not an option for hackers and personal projects.\nAfter some research, I found CMUSphinx project, which seems to be the best project in the area of voice recognition. PocketSphinx toolkit is the version you want for embedded CPUs, as it\u0026rsquo;s pure C, and rather portable.\nThe documentation is not very friendly, but once you get it going, it works well.\nThe first step is to download and install SphinxBase, followed by PocketSphinx. The README has instructions to compile and install, but it\u0026rsquo;s the basic\n./configure make make install By default it\u0026rsquo;ll install binaries to /usr/local/bin, and language models to /usr/local/share. Make sure you have swig and alsa drivers installed before starting (apt-get install swig alsa-base alsa-utils).\nOnce installed, you need to figure out which dictionary model you want to use. Just for testing, I created a dictionary with 106 words, based on the old Logo language (remember the Logo turtle?), like forward, backward, turn right, turn left, etc.\nBefore you can start training PocketSphinx, you\u0026rsquo;ll need an acoustic model. Sadly, the speech corpus (i.e., audio files with spoken words) used to train the models are usually closed source. So either you spend a couple of hours recording the voices (or using an4/Voxforge) to train your own model, or you\u0026rsquo;ll skip this entirely and just use some of the built-in models, accepting lower accuracy. Given my limited number of words in the dictionary, I decided to go with built in acoustic models.\nNext, you need to describe your Language Model - the words, grammar, and frequency of words that you want to recognize. This tutorial has more details. If you\u0026rsquo;re in a hurry and just want to get PocketSphinx going with a dictionary for your pre-defined words, save yourself some trouble and use the online lmtool. This webservice will allow you to upload your dictionary file (a simple ASCII file, with one sentence or word per line), and it\u0026rsquo;ll generate all the language models you need to run PocketSphinx.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a sample of my dictionary file:\nannounce answer ask back clipboard color copy count ... sentence set space square root stamp wait wait until when who word If you want to play with this dictionary, download these files here, and run:\npocketsphinx_continuous -lm lm/logo.lm -dict lm/logo.dic (note: if pocketsphinx is stuck at READY, it\u0026rsquo;s probably listening to the wrong hw device. Check where is the microphone attached via cat /proc/asound/cards, and add -adcdev plughw:X,0 to the line above, replacing X by the hardware id of your microphone).\npocketsphinx_continuous -lm lm/logo.lm -dict lm/logo.dic -adcdev plughw:2,0 Smartphones use all sorts of tricks to cancel the background noise, but that requires special hardware, so you\u0026rsquo;ll need a reasonable quiet environment. Otherwise the accuracy will suffer, depending on how large your dictionary is.\nAs you would expect, smaller dictionaries have much better accuracy. With a 100-word, I got 60-70% correct. After I reduced to a simple 15-words dictionary, I got virtually 100% match rate, even with some background noise and a non-American accent. Certainly enough for my projects.\nNext up: running this on a Raspberry Pi, installing a decent openair microphone, and testing overall performance when connected to a home automation system.

It\u0026rsquo;s a shame that Linux keyboard is still horribly broken by default (some may say it\u0026rsquo;s by design; no, it\u0026rsquo;s not).\nIt has been asked before, but most answers will point you to use xim, which will open another can of worms.

Some say it\u0026rsquo;ll the the digital renaissance; others claim it\u0026rsquo;s the best thing to ever happen to the web, after the browser itself.\nThis video summarizes well the sentiment:\nThis is wrong.\nTen years from now we\u0026rsquo;ll look back and realize how much the new gTLDs have hurt us.\nFirst, most of the new gTLDs add little or no value. I bet we could live another 50 years without a .ninja, a .soy, .fail, .florist, or .loans.\nOthers will proclaim that the new gTLDs are useful, and point to domains like .nyc, .london, or .website, as examples of the \u0026ldquo;democratization\u0026rdquo; promoted by the new categories.\nBut these will be the exception rather than the rule. In practice the new gTLDS will force brands to spend millions of dollars to protect against cybersquatters rushing to claim new brand-related domains, amongst other threats.\nBefore you had to register your brand across a handful of TLDs. Now you have 1,400 more to worry about. That\u0026rsquo;s like a whack-a-mole game, but you\u0026rsquo;re outnumbered by hundreds of moles for each hand you have.\nAnd yet, this is not my main concern. Brands got screwed and will spend a ton of money, while domain registrars will be laughing all the way to the bank. Whatever, life will be fine.\nMy concern is a different one: the new gTLDs will accelerate the demise of the URI.\nWe already lost users to search. It\u0026rsquo;s more convenient to type \u0026ldquo;Brand\u0026rdquo; on the browser and let your search engine do the rest than typing \u0026ldquo;brand.com\u0026rdquo;. And on mobile the URL is already hidden from the user, as if it were an irrelevant technical implementation detail. Same on Safari on desktop.\nBut now multiply this situation by thousands of gTLDs, and you\u0026rsquo;ll have the perfect Paradox of Choice. Is it a .com, a .net, .cc? Nops. Keep going friend.\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s add to the mix the fact that a) most of the mobile traffic is already coming from native apps, and b) Apple is pushing to bury the URI, and c) Google is replacing everything by its omni-search. And we\u0026rsquo;re not even talking about Siri or voice-activated search. This will result in a very different world. My prediction: thanks to the new gTLDs, mobile apps and commercial players will have even more control than today, and URLs will be demoted to second-class citizens. They will still be there, but buried somewhere in the sub-menus of your browser, or the API of your Chrome extensions. Just like IP addresses; you know it\u0026rsquo;s there somewhere, but nobody cares.\nIn the name of find-ability and ease of use, we\u0026rsquo;ll live in an URL-less world. And commercial entities will be rewarded and profit from your traffic.\nI\u0026rsquo;m sure that\u0026rsquo;s not the web that Sir Tim Berners-Lee envisioned 25 years ago.\n","permalink":"https://wrgms.com/gtlds-and-the-death-of-urls/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eUnless you\u0026rsquo;ve been living under a rock, you\u0026rsquo;ve read \u003cem\u003ead nauseum\u003c/em\u003e about the overly optimistic predictions for the new gTLDs.

Wrong.\nBut this time I was the one to blame.\nAfter solving the conflict with bash, I changed /etc/passwd user shell to /bin/bash. The only problem is that Synology wipes the system partition during firmware upgrades, so when I upgraded to DSM 4.1.2668, my custom `/bin/bash``was gone. Of course this locked me out of the system. No SSH, SCP or FTP. Great.\nAfter a few moments of panic, I remembered I still had the serial console. So I could put Linux in single user mode, and drop into recovery mode.\nSo if you\u0026rsquo;re ever in a similar situation, here\u0026rsquo;s how to fix it:\n1. First, you need a serial console.\n2. During U-Boot, press any key to cancel the automatic kernel boot (Hit any key to stop autoboot).\n3. Enter printenv to check the environment variables. Search for bootargs and bootm variables (they will be different on your system, so do NOT copy and paste from mine, unless you have a Synology DS212+ with the same DSM).\n4. Append reboot=cold,hard emergency init=/bin/sh to the end of bootargs variable. In my case, this is what I used:\nsetenv bootargs \u0026#39;console=ttyS0,115200 ip=off initrd=0x00800040,4M root=/dev/md0 rw syno_hw_version=DS212pv20 ihd_num=2 netif_num=1 esata_7042=1 reboot=cold,hard emergency init=/bin/sh\u0026#39; (again, your parameters will likely be different, so don\u0026rsquo;t copy and paste)\n5. Boot your kernel, with\nbootm F8080000 F8280000 Now your Synology should be happily botting in single user mode, ignoring /etc/passwd and dropping you to a plain shell. Do what you have to do to fix the system, and reboot.\nYou can also use these steps to recover your system partition from a crash or other problem.\n","permalink":"https://wrgms.com/entering-single-user-mode-on-a-synology/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/content/images/2013/01/synology.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hope this will be my last post about Synology for a while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter dealing for a few weeks with an \u003ca href=\"http://forum.synology.com/enu/viewtopic.php?f=221\u0026amp;t=59808\u0026amp;start=45#p232455\"\u003eunstable environment\u003c/a\u003e, then \u003ca href=\"/recovering-a-failed-synology-diskstation-ds2xx-serial\"\u003ehacking a serial console\u003c/a\u003e to troubleshoot, then \u003ca href=\"/synologys-secret-telnet-password/\"\u003ecracking the secret recovery telnet password\u003c/a\u003e just for fun, and finally solving the \u003ca href=\"http://serverfault.com/questions/458553/cant-log-in-via-ssh-to-any-accounts-set-to-use-bin-bash-as-a-default-shell/\"\u003eweird mistery\u003c/a\u003e of SSH \u003ca href=\"/reverse-engineering-synology-openssh\"\u003enot accepting /bin/bash as default shell\u003c/a\u003e, I thought I finally had a stable environment.

The user has to be called \u0026ldquo;root\u0026rdquo;.\nWHAAAT?\nThankfully, Synology uses a modified Linux distribution, so they publish the code under GPL.\nAfter a couple of hours looking at the OpenSSH source code, things became pretty obvious. Here\u0026rsquo;s the piece of code from their version of OpenSSH 5.8p1, file session.c:\nvoid do_child(Session *s, const char *command) { ... #ifdef MY_ABC_HERE char szValue[8]; int RunSSH = 0; SSH_CMD SSHCmd = REQ_UNKNOWN; if (1 == GetKeyValue(\u0026#34;/etc/synoinfo.conf\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;runssh\u0026#34;, szValue, sizeof(szValue))) { if (strcasecmp(szValue, \u0026#34;yes\u0026#34;) == 0) { RunSSH = 1; } } if (IsSFTPReq(command)){ SSHCmd = REQ_SFTP; } else if (IsRsyncReq(command)){ SSHCmd = REQ_RSYNC; } else if (IsTimebkpRequest(command)){ SSHCmd = REQ_TIMEBKP; } else if (RunSSH \u0026amp;amp;\u0026amp;amp; IsAllowShell(pw)){ SSHCmd = REQ_SHELL; } else { goto Err; } if (REQ_RSYNC == SSHCmd) { pw = SYNOChgValForRsync(pw); } if (!SSHCanLogin(SSHCmd, pw)) { goto Err; } goto Pass; Err: fprintf(stderr, \u0026#34;Permission denied, please try again.\\n\u0026#34;); exit(1); Pass: #endif /* MY_ABC_HERE */ ... } And here is the IsAllowShell(pw):\nstatic int IsAllowShell(const struct passwd *pw) { struct passwd *pUnPrivilege = NULL; char *szUserName = NULL; if (!pw || !pw-\u0026amp;gt;pw_name) { return 0; } szUserName = pw-\u0026amp;gt;pw_name; if(!strcmp(szUserName, \u0026#34;root\u0026#34;) || !strcmp(szUserName, \u0026#34;admin\u0026#34;)){ return 1; } if (NULL != (pUnPrivilege = getpwnam(szUserName))){ if (!strcmp(pUnPrivilege-\u0026amp;gt;pw_shell, \u0026#34;/bin/sh\u0026#34;) || !strcmp(pUnPrivilege-\u0026amp;gt;pw_shell, \u0026#34;/bin/ash\u0026#34;)) { return 1; } } return 0; } Basically synology created a heavily customized version of OpenSSH, including a handful of hacks - e.g., additional checking before accepting a login to see if the SSH service is enabled within the web interface, or stripping special chars (;, |, \u0026lsquo;) from rsync commands, and\u0026hellip; wait for it\u0026hellip; blocking anyone other than root or admin from using any shell other than /bin/sh or /bin/ash.\nOnce identified the cause, the fix was easy: just remove the call to IsAllowShell(). Cross-compile, upload to the NAS, reboot and voilà, regular users can now use bash normally.\nThe hardest part was to get cross-compiling working properly.

Or you simply don\u0026rsquo;t like the idea of having your port 23 open to the world for god-knows-how-long until a Synology tech support can look into your case.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ve probably tried telneting to your NAS. Maybe you\u0026rsquo;ve even tried opening the case and hacking the serial port, only to discover that you don\u0026rsquo;t have the root password. The DS Assistant password doesn\u0026rsquo;t work, and you exhausted all obvious guesses - blank, synopass, synology, password, admin, root, etc.\nWell, what about c12-0804? No, I didn\u0026rsquo;t make this up. This is today\u0026rsquo;s password.\nBut if you\u0026rsquo;re reading this a few days (or years) from now, too bad; it won\u0026rsquo;t work. Unless, of course, you wait until December 8th. Because the password repeats every year.\nBasically Synology hardcoded a modified login binary within the firmware that accepts an obfuscated password for root, which depends on the current date. (by the way, this isn\u0026rsquo;t the only thing Synology folks hardcoded in the firmware).\nThanks to GPL, Synology was forced to publish the original source code for the firmware. Based on the original correct_password.c code, I hacked a short snippet to generate the daily password.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the Synology Telnet password generator:\n#include \u0026amp;lt;stdlib.h\u0026amp;gt; #include \u0026amp;lt;time.h\u0026amp;gt; #include \u0026amp;lt;stdio.h\u0026amp;gt; void main() { struct timeval tvTime; struct tm tmOutput; gettimeofday(\u0026amp;amp;tvTime, 0); localtime_r(\u0026amp;amp;(tvTime.tv_sec), \u0026amp;amp;tmOutput); tmOutput.tm_mon += 1; printf(\u0026#34;password for today is: %x%02d-%02x%02d\\n\\n\u0026#34;, tmOutput.tm_mon, tmOutput.tm_mon, tmOutput.tm_mday, gcd(tmOutput.tm_mon, tmOutput.tm_mday)); } int gcd(int a, int b) { return (b?gcd(b,a%b):a); } Compile and run the code above with gcc. You can also use the excellent Codepad Repl.it to run the code online and get the password for today (no registration needed).\nBonus tip: if you\u0026rsquo;re curious how exactly the password is generated, here\u0026rsquo;s the algorithm:\n1st character = month in hexadecimal, lower case (1=Jan, \u0026hellip; , a=Oct, b=Nov, c=Dec) 2-3 = month in decimal, zero padded and starting in 1 (01, 02, 03, \u0026hellip;, 11, 12) 4 = dash 5-6 = day of the month in hex (01, 02 .., 0A, .., 1F) 7-8 = greatest common divisor between month and day, zero padded. This is always a number between 01 and 12. So, let\u0026rsquo;s say today is October 15, the password would be: a10-0f05 where a = month in hex, 10 = month in decimal, 0f = day in hex, 05 = greatest divisor between 10 and 15).\nIf you have trouble calculating the greatest common divisor (elementary math, anyone?), Wolfram Alpha is your friend.\nThis was tested on a Synology DS212+, with Marvell Kirkwood mv6282 chipset. It\u0026rsquo;s unlikely but still possible that different models use a different algorithm. YMMV, so always check the source code.\n[UPDATE 1: Several users reported that this works in many other models, including DS409, DS112j, etc. Please leave a comment with your model and firmware version.]\n[UPDATE 2: If it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work, it\u0026rsquo;s probably that your date is incorrect in the NAS. Per Patrick\u0026rsquo;s suggestion in the comments below, try \u0026ldquo;101-0101\u0026rdquo;, which is the password for Jan 01]\n","permalink":"https://wrgms.com/synologys-secret-telnet-password/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIf you have a Synology NAS and had some sort of disk crash in the past, you\u0026rsquo;ve probably encountered the famous \u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;Cannot format system partition\u0026rdquo;\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;Please configure your router to forward port 23 to DiskStation and contact Synology online support\u0026rdquo;\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, it sucks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt sucks even more when you know the disk is perfectly fine, and you still have hopes to recover your data.

The software is robust and much better than my old DroboFS, and the fact that it is entirely open source is a big plus.\nI recently upgraded the firmware to DSM 2661. Everything worked fine. For 12 hours. The next morning, the device was dead, with the blue blink of death).\nWas it the new firmware? Or maybe a disk crash? Who knows.\nI followed the basic tests recommended by Synology: remove both disks, turn it on and wait 30s for a long beep. Beeeeeep. Great, the motherboard is still functional. It also responded to ping and showed up on DS Assistant, so processor and ethernet are also working fine.\nThe Synology DS NAS is basically an embedded Linux box, using md + lvm for RAID. Nothing is proprietary, so I mounted the disks on my Linux desktop and spent a few more hours cloning and re-building the RAID using a spare disk. Life is good.\nTill\u0026hellip; it crashed again.\nThere was something wrong with the system partition, so I wanted to see inside the NAS, before the kernel finishes booting.\nThankfully, Synology folks already put a physical serial port in there. It\u0026rsquo;s not documented, but it\u0026rsquo;s not hard to find. You just have to open the case.\nDisclaimer: make sure you have backup! I am not responsible if you lose your data, void your warranty, burn down your house or kill your dog.\nStart by opening the case. Here\u0026rsquo;s a video with instructions [update: the original video is not available anymore, but here\u0026rsquo;s a similar one]. Be aware this may break the small internal hooks, and you\u0026rsquo;ll need to use tape or hot glue to put it back together (what\u0026rsquo;s wrong with manufacturers these days? What\u0026rsquo;s the problem with good old screws?) Inside the case, look for a 6-pin header, normally labeled JP2 (or COM1 on older models). The pins likely are: Pin Number Function Confirmed on Synology DS212+ \u0026nbsp; 13.3V 2GND 4TX 6RX Now connect the pins 2, 4 and 6 (respectively GNS, TX, RX) to your USB-TTL 3v3 cable (if using the FTDI cable from Adafruit, it\u0026rsquo;ll be 1-black, 5-yellow, 4-orange. Make sure you don\u0026rsquo;t short-circuit any of the pins. These male-female jumper wires could be useful. Open your preferred terminal program (under Win ExtraPutty is the best in town), set to 115200, disable xon/xoff, and you\u0026rsquo;re all set. Now you can turn on your DS, and see all the beauty of what\u0026rsquo;s going on under the hood:\n__ __ _ _ | \\/ | __ _ _ ____ _____| | | | |\\/| |/ _` | \u0026#39;__\\ \\ / / _ \\ | | | | | | (_| | | \\ V / __/ | | |_| |_|\\__,_|_| \\_/ \\___|_|_| _ _ ____ _ | | | | | __ ) ___ ___ | |_ | | | |___| _ \\ / _ \\ / _ \\| __| | |_| |___| |_) | (_) | (_) | |_ \\___/ |____/ \\___/ \\___/ \\__| ** LOADER ** ** MARVELL BOARD: Synology Disk Station LE U-Boot 1.1.4 (Dec 2 2011 - 15:56:02) Marvell version: 3.5.9 U-Boot code: 00600000 -\u0026amp;gt; 0067FFF0 BSS: -\u0026amp;gt; 0068B3D4 Soc: 88F6282 A1CPU running @ 2000Mhz L2 running @ 500Mhz SysClock = 500Mhz , TClock = 200Mhz DRAM (DDR3) CAS Latency = 7 tRP = 7 tRAS = 20 tRCD=7 DRAM CS[0] base 0x00000000 size 256MB DRAM CS[1] base 0x10000000 size 256MB DRAM Total size 512MB 16bit width Addresses 8M - 0M are saved for the U-Boot usage.

It\u0026rsquo;s sad to see so much work and love going nowhere. At least they were classy and wrote a candid and honest shutting-down post, and they\u0026rsquo;re even refunding users (!). That\u0026rsquo;s a level of integrity that you don\u0026rsquo;t see everyday in the startup world.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;ve never played Glitch, it\u0026rsquo;s now too late. The game world is now restricted to existing users, and everything will shut down on December 9th 2012. Here\u0026rsquo;s some videos to give you an idea of what you missed.\nI was part of the first wave of beta testers. Even though I\u0026rsquo;ve never spent much time playing, I remember how every detail was carefullyt thought through, and painstakenly executed. The videos don\u0026rsquo;t do justice to their attention to detail.\nBut, aside from the intrinsic beauty, the gameplay was dull. It was just a cute massive multiplayer social game. Maybe the cutest ever. But without a strong storytelling or any of the gamification tactics from other social gaming companies, there was no reason for you to keep coming back.\nIn a world of \u0026ldquo;Your crops are dying! Your friend Samantha just moved to a farm next door. Invite your friends to level up faster.\u0026rdquo;, it\u0026rsquo;s hard to keep users engaged these days.\nThis reminds me of the Steve Blank\u0026rsquo;s MVP stories. Do you need to develop a full game, with so many levels, intricate dialogues, dozens of non-playable characters, only to realize that your users aren\u0026rsquo;t coming back in the first place?\nCan\u0026rsquo;t you create a demo with a couple of levels and a handful of hard-coded NPCs, and invite your mom/sister/significant other to play? Just check how many times they come back (when you\u0026rsquo;re not looking). You\u0026rsquo;ll achieve the same conclusions, with 10% of the effort.\nOf course hindsight is a bitch \u0026ndash; or, like someone said on HN: \u0026quot;\u0026hellip;hindsight is a Glitch\u0026quot; :). Sometimes you can\u0026rsquo;t just hack an MVP together; you need a fully polished product. But I don\u0026rsquo;t think that\u0026rsquo;s the case here.\nIt seems to me they put too much effort on having a full product, and lost sight of the bigger picture. They repeated some of the same fatal mistakes others have done. For example, Lessons from Habitat outlines many of the same pitfalls, as seen by the creators of Lucasfilm in the mid-80\u0026rsquo;s. The entire paper is a great read, but one part that strikes me as relevant to this discussion:\n\u0026ldquo;While we find much of the work presently being done on elaborate interface technologies \u0026ndash; DataGloves, head-mounted displays, special-purpose rendering engines, and so on \u0026ndash; both exciting and promising, the almost mystical euphoria that currently seems to surround all this hardware is, in our opinion, both excessive and somewhat misplaced.\nWe can\u0026rsquo;t help having a nagging sense that it\u0026rsquo;s all a bit of a distraction from the really pressing issues.\n*At the core of our vision is the idea that cyberspace is necessarily a multiple-participant environment. It seems to us that the things that are important to the inhabitants of such an environment are the capabilities available to them, the characteristics of the other people they encounter there, and the ways these various participants can affect one another.\nBeyond a foundation set of communications capabilities, the details of the technology used to present this environment to its participants, while sexy and interesting, are of relatively peripheral concern.\u0026rdquo;\nKeep in mind the first Habitat was launched in 1986, almost 30 years ago, and ran in 64Kb on a Commodore64.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re now spoiled by Call Of Duty and hyper-realist NBA games. But there\u0026rsquo;s a point to be made that the success of an MMO game is not defined by its level of peripheral sophistication (be it design, cuteness, or head-mounted displays), but by the social experience, and how people interact with each other. Minecraft, with its blocky graphics and limited interactivity, is a prime example.\nGlitch isn\u0026rsquo;t alone in repeating these mistakes. Worlds Chat did the same two decades ago, being the first 3D world ever created. It was later replaced by The Palace. Later Philip Rosedale had his chance with Second Life, which exploded, then burst, and now is becoming cool again (and Philip is trying his hand again with High Fidelity).\nAnother issue with Glitch was its channel distribution. It\u0026rsquo;s challenging in 2012 to succeed with a web-only game, especially if you\u0026rsquo;re not anchored on Facebook. And Glitch was built in Flash (!), so it missed billions of 2-3 minutes slots of free time that people have when waiting for the train, bathroom, elevator.

Sony. HBGary Hack. FBI. Paypal, Visa \u0026amp; MasterCard. Mubarak. Occupy Wall Street. SOPA/PIPA.\nAnonymous has been busy for the past few years. It started as juvenile pranks on 4chan\u0026rsquo;s boards, but grew and became a powerful mechanism against oppressive governments and unscrupulous corporations.\nIts trajectory was beautifully captured in the documentary \u0026ldquo;We Are Legion: The Story of the Hacktivists\u0026rdquo;, that will be released later this year. I had the pleasure to watch the premiere in Austin during SXSW, and I must say - it\u0026rsquo;s f..ing brilliant. The movie is still in post-production, so the theatrical release may be slightly different.\nWe also participated in an exclusive interview with the film director \u0026ldquo;Brian Knappenberger\u0026rdquo;, who was joined on stage by former Anonymous member Gregg Housh and two special guests Anon behind masks: one from Austin, and another just called Anonymous9000, connecting via Skype from an undisclosed location (and using a robotic voice changer). It was a surreal experience.\nTogether they gave a passionate and fascinating perspective of the evolution of Anonymous, its internal workings, and the journey since 4Chan to the present day. They discussed how the group went after the Church of Scientology, why they hacked HBGary, discussed the release of confidential data of Sony customers, and how lately they\u0026rsquo;ve started to engage in social movements around freedom, Occupy Wall Street, the Arab Spring, and the support to Wikileaks\u0026rsquo; founder, Julian Assange.\nA few highlights of the session, in no particular order:\nsome Anons don\u0026rsquo;t agree with the dump of personal information (like in Sony\u0026rsquo;s case). But a few radical sub-groups - like Lulzsec - have a different opinion, and believe the press only pays attention when something concrete happens. Ironically, one of the most vocal supporters of dumping personal data was Sabu - which was revealed last week to be an FBI informant since June 2011. Conflict of interest, maybe?\nAnons in general don\u0026rsquo;t support attacking the press, as they believe in freedom of expression themselves (even when it is press against Anonymous). Some may disagree. Others simply don\u0026rsquo;t care; they\u0026rsquo;re in for the lulz, and accuse others of being moralfags. It\u0026rsquo;s these constant disagreements within Anonymous\u0026rsquo; anarchic structure that gave birth to dissidents, like Lulzsec.\n\u0026ldquo;Thousands of twenty-something socially awkward nerds got laid for the first time due to these movements and events in real life. Behind a mask, they all felt more comfortable in expressing themselves and talking with girls. We saw several marriages between Anons that met while protesting against the Church of Scientology and others\u0026rdquo;.\n\u0026ldquo;The DDoS attacks have just one objective: attract press. Whenever we have a message that we want the press to distribute, we DDoS someone so the press will publish the news that Anonymous attacked again, followed by what we wanted them to communicate. Otherwise we\u0026rsquo;d be just ignored. Look at SOPA/PIPA; we\u0026rsquo;ve been talking about this for years, and no one ever cared. Then we DDoS\u0026rsquo;d RIAA/MPAA/DoJ websites\u0026hellip; and the press showed up in full force overnight.\u0026rdquo;\nWatch the trailer here [YouTube].\nUpdate 2012-11-17: now also available for rental on Vimeo. This is the first time that Vimeo does movie rental. EDIT: Vimeo link is broken, but as of May 2025 it is now available on YouTube.\nUpdate 2012-10-17: it is opening in theatres this weekend. NY, LA, Houston, Canada, Rio de Janeiro and others. Check to see if your city is in the list. You can also pre-order the movie, starting on 10/30.

If you\u0026rsquo;re not one of the 12,000 people already using the service (that\u0026rsquo;s the number Andrea gave during the talk), well\u0026hellip; you should give it a try, because everyone is talking about it. Yeah, I live in the echo chamber, I know.\nGlancee, like its competitors Highlight, Sonar, Banjo, are all exploring the new niche of location social discovery - some sort of Match.com-meets-LinkedIn. Unproven territory, but sounds promising (albeit somewhat dystopian) to me. Andrea spoke about the current status of social discovery apps and the different approaches taken by each player. He also mentioned the incredible growth (hard to see 12,000 as incredible, but startup founders have to drink their own Kool-Aid), particularly with all the buzz around SXSW.\nBut to me the most interesting tidbit was the concept of monetizing the service via Spatial Analysis.\nHe didn\u0026rsquo;t elaborate much, so let me speculate a bit here. Consider that you have a device on your pocket that is connected to Facebook (i.e. knows everything about your attitudinal behavior - including Likes, affinity with brands, reach, friends). You have Glancee installed, and as such it is constantly broadcasting your current geolocation. Every. Single. Minute. Like Google Latitude, but with a Facebook social layer on top of it.\nNot only it knows who you are and what you like, but also where you\u0026rsquo;ve been, where you work, live, play, study, shop, your the preferred gas station, and countries you\u0026rsquo;ve travelled.\nAll this leads to a level of geospatial analysis never seen before, using all your social graph as an extra dimension. You could plot heatmaps showing location of people that liked your brand on FB, and use to optimize out-of-home media placement. Or monitor the consumers of a competitor brand when planning new physical stores. Basically it\u0026rsquo;s any marketer\u0026rsquo;s dream come true.\nOf course, it has just one small problem: it needs permission, and critical mass. You need tens of millions of users using the service, in order to have a meaningful representation.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why Andreas was so adamant when I asked him about his number one goal: \u0026ldquo;Growth. And fast\u0026rdquo;.\nUpdate 2012-05-04: it seems Facebook may agree with me here \u0026ndash; Facebook just announced they\u0026rsquo;re acquiring Glancee. I guess Andrea can scratch off \u0026ldquo;Growth\u0026rdquo; from his list.\n","permalink":"https://wrgms.com/glancee/","summary":"\u003ccenter\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Glancee at SXSW\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/content/images/2014/Feb/glancee.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/center\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy last session of SXSW Day 2 was with \u003ca href=\"http://andreavaccari.com/\"\u003eAndrea Vaccari\u003c/a\u003e, the CEO of the trendy location-based discovery startup \u003ca href=\"http://www.glancee.com/\"\u003eGlancee\u003c/a\u003e.

But despite recent progress with Content Network and YouTube, the marketing community still see the search giant as a way to drive conversion at the bottom of the funnel. In order to move to the next level, Google has to prove they can create emotional connections with consumers.\nEnter Project Re:Brief, just announced during SXSW.\nAccording to Aman Govil, Google\u0026rsquo;s Product Marketing Manager, the idea was to \u0026ldquo;re-imagine iconic campaigns of 4 classic global brands through the lenses of modern technology\u0026rdquo;. The project aims to be a benchmark of what is possible when you have the right idea and the perfect balance between creativity \u0026amp; technology.\nThe brands were carefully selected: Coca-Cola with Hilltop, Volvo with Drive it like you hate it, Avis We try harder, and Alka-Seltzer I can\u0026rsquo;t believe I ate the whole thing. The secret sauce was that they brought back from retirement the original creators of these 4 campaigns, and paired them with digital creatives, so they could re-imagine their original creations, leveraging today\u0026rsquo;s technology.\nIt was fascinating to see people like Harvey Gabor (Coca-Cola\u0026rsquo;s Hilltop, 1971) working with a bunch of twenty-something, and discovering how to use touch screens, mobile, realtime web.\nI had the opportunity to chat with Aman and Drew (the global creative director for the new campaigns) to understand how they pulled it together. Surprisingly, each project took just 2-3 months, and were executed with a relatively small budget (\u0026ldquo;Less than a TV spots\u0026rdquo;, told me Drew). Seems the advertisers were initially resistant to touch iconic pieces like Hilltop, but eventually understood the spirit of the project, and loved the opportunity to work with the original creators.\nWhat is even more fascinating is that not a single can of Coke or Alka-Seltzer was sold because this initiative. Google pulled this off not to help their clients sell more, but to help themseves. The target audience was marketers and agencies, hoping they would talk, comment, write blog posts. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t get more meta than this.\nCheck out more at www.projectrebrief.com, and look for the documentary later this year.\nUpdate 2012-06-22: the full documentary is now available on YouTube.\n","permalink":"https://wrgms.com/rebrief/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/content/images/2014/Feb/google_rebrief-1.png\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the past years Google has been trying to go beyond search, diversifying their revenue sources.

It took me some time to make it work like I wanted (keyboard, extensions, application menu, etc), but I\u0026rsquo;m quite happy with everything. Or almost everything.\nOne thing I enjoyed over the years was the ability to customize my keyboard shortcuts. I have dozens of shotcuts - to center windows on my screen, to open programs, start and stop Spotify, to run macros, to log in to my remote servers, and so on.\nOne of my handy shortcuts is \u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;F1\u0026gt; to open an xterm with superuser, and \u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;F2\u0026gt; for regular user. I use custom xterm profiles, so I can easily check if I\u0026rsquo;m running under a privileged context by looking at the color of the window.\nThis worked well for years under Ubuntu 14.04 and Gnome 3.20, but stopped working with the upgrade to Bionic Beaver. More specifically, \u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;F1\u0026gt; is now System Help, with no way to change it.\n\u0026ldquo;No problem\u0026rdquo;, I thought; this can be easily adjusted in System Settings.\nNops.\nI searched around, and found other folks with the same problem, but no solution.\nI then decided to dug into the source code, and discovered the improbable: Gnome devs decided the help was so important that it deserved its own unique, hardcoded, and immutable shortcut. If you want to reassign it, you\u0026rsquo;re out of luck.\nAccording to gnome-settings-daemon changelog:\n=============== Version 3.21.90 =============== ... Media keys: - Add Super+F1 as a hardcoded shortcut for launching Help ... REALLY? What\u0026rsquo;s wrong with a default icon in the toolbar, or maybe a popup window when you boot for the first time? Also, does anyone really care about reading the basic documentation for\u0026hellip; a windows manager?\nI wasn\u0026rsquo;t convinced yet, but a closer look at the source code confirmed my fear: there it was: (file /gnome-settings-daemon/blob/master/plugins/media-keys/shortcuts-list.h):\n{ HELP_KEY, NULL, N_(\u0026#34;Help\u0026#34;), \u0026#34;\u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;F1\u0026#34;, GSD_ACTION_MODE_LAUNCHER }, So if you\u0026rsquo;re really determined to regain control of your \u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;F1\u0026gt;, there\u0026rsquo;s only one solution: to recompile gnome-settings-daemon, and replace the gsd-media-keys plugin. Spoiler alert: I\u0026rsquo;m glad to report that my patch was successful, but beware: getting the right dependencies and recompiling Gnome is not an easy feat. Keep reading if you\u0026rsquo;re interested in doing the same:\nDownload and install Gnome Builder Click on \u0026ldquo;Clone\u0026rdquo;, select a local directory (e.g., ~/Projects/) and use the official repo at https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-settings-daemon Open xterm, and enter cd ~/Projects/gnome-settings-daemon; git checkout tags/GNOME_SETTINGS_DAEMON_3_28_1 (you can check your exact version with gnome-shell --version. Check all tags available with git tag -l) Install all dependencies. These were the ones missing in my system, but YMMV: apt install libcolord-dev \\ libgeocode-glib-dev \\ gnome-desktop3-data \\ libgnome-desktop-3-dev \\ libgweather-3-dev \\ libcanberra-gtk3-dev \\ libgeoclue-2-dev \\ libnotify-dev \\ libpulse-mainloop-glib0 \\ libpulse-dev \\ gobject-introspection \\ libupower-glib-dev \\ libpolkit-gobject-1-dev \\ libasound2-dev \\ libgudev-1.0-dev \\ libwacom-dev \\ libnss3-dev \\ libcups2-dev \\ libnm-dev Patch the source code by editing ~/Projects/gnome-settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/shortcuts-list.h, and add a comment in front of the offender, like below (for Gnome 3.28.1 it is in line 69): // disabled! // { HELP_KEY, NULL, N_(\u0026#34;Help\u0026#34;), \u0026#34;\u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;F1\u0026#34;, GSD_ACTION_MODE_LAUNCHER }, Click [Rebuild] button in the Builder UI to compile (note: you need to click Rebuild, and not Build). You may want to turn off the deprecation warnings by editing meson.build and adding '-Wno-deprecated-declarations' to test_cflags = [...]; (line 70). If you installed all the dependencies correctly, you should have no warnings nor errors. Find the compiled binaries. You\u0026rsquo;re looking specifically for the plugin gsd-media-keys, so it\u0026rsquo;ll likely be in the directory ~/.var/app/org.gnome.Builder/cache/gnome-builder/projects/gnome-settings-daemon/builds/default-host-HEAD/plugins/media-keys cd ~/.var/app/org.gnome.Builder/cache/gnome-builder/projects/gnome-settings-daemon/builds/default-host-HEAD/plugins/media-keys ~ cp ./gsd-media-keys ~/gsd-media-keys.patched Before proceeding, you may want to inspect your binary to confirm it successfully linked with shared libraries by using ldd ~/gsd-media-keys.patched. In my case I had problems finding libgsd.so, so I solved it by adding the path to ldconfig (although the correct solution would be to fix this in the build system): sudo sh -c \u0026#39;echo \u0026#34;# gnome-settings-daemon\\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gnome-settings-daemon-3.0/\\n\u0026#34; \u0026gt; /etc/ld.so.conf.d/gnome-settings-daemon.conf\u0026#39; sudo ldconfig You\u0026rsquo;re now ready to install the patched gsd-media-keys binary in your system: cd /usr/lib/gnome-settings-daemon/ sudo mv ~/gsd-media-keys.patched . sudo strip -s ./gsd-media-keys.patched sudo mv gsd-media-keys gsd-media-keys.orig sudo ln -s gsd-media-keys.patched gsd-media-keys Log out or reboot, and you\u0026rsquo;re done! If all goes well, your system now should be running the gsd-media-keys plugin without the \u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;F1\u0026gt; hardcoded, so you can reassign to anything you like.\nIf anything goes wrong and you can\u0026rsquo;t log in, don\u0026rsquo;t despair. Simply open a console terminal by using \u0026lt;Ctrl\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;Alt\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;F2\u0026gt; and restore your original gsd-media-keys binary by doing:\ncd /usr/lib/gnome-settings-daemon/ sudo rm gsd-media-keys sudo ln -s gsd-media-keys.orig gsd-media-keys Use \u0026lt;Ctrl\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;Alt\u0026gt;\u0026lt;F1\u0026gt; to go back to Gnome and log in again. You can then inspect /var/log/syslog to understand what went wrong (search for \u0026ldquo;media-keys\u0026rdquo;). It\u0026rsquo;s likely that you had problems with the dynamic libraries in step 8 above.\n","permalink":"https://wrgms.com/fixing-gnome-3-2x-hardcoded-superf1-shortcut/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eUbuntu 18.04 LTS is finally out, and with it you now have Gnome out of the box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve been using Gnome for several years, and have enjoyed its minimalism.

You may smile. But it will come…” [Henry Ford, 1940]\nFlying cars are not something new. The idea has been going around since the 19th century, even before the very first flight by Santos-Dumont (or Wright Brothers, depending on your bias). But it was The Jetsons who first brought the concept of flying cars to the masses. We grew up dreaming that one day we\u0026rsquo;d be able to get in our cars and fly straight to our destination - fast, safely, and traffic-free.\nThanks to Moore\u0026rsquo;s Law and the latest advances in engineering, we may be closer to flying cars than you think.\nAeroMobil is an innovative company from Slovakia, founded by Štefan Klein and Juraj Vaculik. Štefan, a well-known designer for Audi, Volkswagen and BMW, has been pursuing this idea for more than two decades. Juraj has a long and successful track record in advertising and as an investor. The two minds came together to create the company and make the dream a reality.\nDuring his talk at SXSW today, Juraj talked about the latest advances and their recent flying prototypes. As you can see on the two videos below, they made quite a progress between version 2.5 (early 2013) and 3.0 (late 2014).\nAeroMobil 2.5:\nAeroMobil 3.0: (note that Štefan himself test drives every prototype. He believes no one understand the machines better than him)\nDespite the progress, don\u0026rsquo;t expect to be driving - err.. flying - just yet. There are still several roadblocks (no pun intended) before mass adoption. They still need to figure out logistical challenges, like fueling stations, or grass strips next to roads for landing and take off. And change legislations, and define new testing procedures and certification. Or get people certified as pilots (yeah, don\u0026rsquo;t think your driver\u0026rsquo;s license will fly).\nBut with Google investing so heavily in self-driving cars, and SpaceX sending rockets to space, it\u0026rsquo;s not hard to imagine these efforts converging and eventually giving birth to self-driving flying cars. It might sound crazy at first, but there\u0026rsquo;s a good chance we\u0026rsquo;ll see it in our lifetime. AeroMobil may be in the exact spot that Paul Graham calls a Frighteningly Ambitious Startup Idea.\nCrazy? Yes.

With 800+ sessions this year, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to get overwhelmed. But get over your FOMO, and enjoy the serendipity. You will miss many good sessions, and that\u0026rsquo;s OK. The best talk will be that one you didn\u0026rsquo;t plan, and just entered because your first option was full.\nSpeaking of crowded sessions: always have a plan B. Your first option will likely be full, so having a second/third option is always important.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t go to panels. Ever. There\u0026rsquo;s hardly enough time for one person to convey a good idea in under 60 minutes. 4 or 5 becomes a festival of shallow sound bites. You already have Twitter for those.\nSeek geeky and obscure talks. The less buzzwords on the description, the better. Extra points if the talk is by someone who is actually making things - rather than people talking about those who made it. I saw some unbelievably good sessions in the past which had less 20 participants in the audience.\nBring an extra battery pack. Your phone will die midday, even if you have an iPhone 6 Plus. Pack some extra juice.\nPlan your commute time between sessions. Some venues are 2 miles away from Austin Convention Center, and shuttles may take 15-30 min door-to-door. Try Lyft/Uber, or pedicabs. Or you can be ultra-hipster and apply for a loaner Boosted Board. I already secured mine!\nDriving is usually a bad idea. Parking is expensive, and you may want to have a beer or two (or six or ten). Get an Uber/Lyft, or use the official shuttles, but be prepared to spend one hour each way. And remind yourself next time to book your ticket the exact minute they go on sale, and enjoy the convenience of a hotel in walking distance.\nHave a good breakfast. You won\u0026rsquo;t eat much during the day, and you\u0026rsquo;re probably still recovering from last night.\nRSVPs are usually useless. Most of the parties don\u0026rsquo;t require RSVP, and use it just to collect email addresses. And the ones that do are not the ones you see on blogs. [EDIT: this used to be true, but it\u0026rsquo;s now starting to change. Many parties are now respecting RSVPs, and even many of the talks in the official program started to require reservation, so play safe and do your homework.]\nRemember: SXSW is a marathon, not a sprint. It\u0026rsquo;s 5 full days (double if you do Music/Film), so take time to enjoy yourself. It\u0026rsquo;s Spring, and there\u0026rsquo;s no better time to be in Austin.

The requirements are:\nMust be able to listen continuously Run on embedded ARM processors (particuarly Raspberry Pi and BeagleBone Black) Good accuracy on a limited set of words (English only) Decent performance, particularly on low-power CPUs My first thought was to use Google Speech API. The accuracy is great, and it\u0026rsquo;s reasonably fast. But it is also limited to only 50 calls per day, so it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t satisfy requirement #1. And I don\u0026rsquo;t like the idea of streaming all of my personal conversations to anyone. It\u0026rsquo;s already enough to have NSA listening to my phone calls\u0026hellip;\n(maybe it\u0026rsquo;s an option for the future, when implementing something with a physical push-button, like a Star Trek communicator device)\nSiriProxy is another neat hack, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work with iOS7/8 anymore. Apple will soon offer an official interface to Siri via its HomeKit program, but it\u0026rsquo;ll only work with licensed hardware. Likely not an option for hackers and personal projects.\nAfter some research, I found CMUSphinx project, which seems to be the best project in the area of voice recognition. PocketSphinx toolkit is the version you want for embedded CPUs, as it\u0026rsquo;s pure C, and rather portable.\nThe documentation is not very friendly, but once you get it going, it works well.\nThe first step is to download and install SphinxBase, followed by PocketSphinx. The README has instructions to compile and install, but it\u0026rsquo;s the basic\n./configure make make install By default it\u0026rsquo;ll install binaries to /usr/local/bin, and language models to /usr/local/share. Make sure you have swig and alsa drivers installed before starting (apt-get install swig alsa-base alsa-utils).\nOnce installed, you need to figure out which dictionary model you want to use. Just for testing, I created a dictionary with 106 words, based on the old Logo language (remember the Logo turtle?), like forward, backward, turn right, turn left, etc.\nBefore you can start training PocketSphinx, you\u0026rsquo;ll need an acoustic model. Sadly, the speech corpus (i.e., audio files with spoken words) used to train the models are usually closed source. So either you spend a couple of hours recording the voices (or using an4/Voxforge) to train your own model, or you\u0026rsquo;ll skip this entirely and just use some of the built-in models, accepting lower accuracy. Given my limited number of words in the dictionary, I decided to go with built in acoustic models.\nNext, you need to describe your Language Model - the words, grammar, and frequency of words that you want to recognize. This tutorial has more details. If you\u0026rsquo;re in a hurry and just want to get PocketSphinx going with a dictionary for your pre-defined words, save yourself some trouble and use the online lmtool. This webservice will allow you to upload your dictionary file (a simple ASCII file, with one sentence or word per line), and it\u0026rsquo;ll generate all the language models you need to run PocketSphinx.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a sample of my dictionary file:\nannounce answer ask back clipboard color copy count ... sentence set space square root stamp wait wait until when who word If you want to play with this dictionary, download these files here, and run:\npocketsphinx_continuous -lm lm/logo.lm -dict lm/logo.dic (note: if pocketsphinx is stuck at READY, it\u0026rsquo;s probably listening to the wrong hw device. Check where is the microphone attached via cat /proc/asound/cards, and add -adcdev plughw:X,0 to the line above, replacing X by the hardware id of your microphone).\npocketsphinx_continuous -lm lm/logo.lm -dict lm/logo.dic -adcdev plughw:2,0 Smartphones use all sorts of tricks to cancel the background noise, but that requires special hardware, so you\u0026rsquo;ll need a reasonable quiet environment. Otherwise the accuracy will suffer, depending on how large your dictionary is.\nAs you would expect, smaller dictionaries have much better accuracy. With a 100-word, I got 60-70% correct. After I reduced to a simple 15-words dictionary, I got virtually 100% match rate, even with some background noise and a non-American accent. Certainly enough for my projects.\nNext up: running this on a Raspberry Pi, installing a decent openair microphone, and testing overall performance when connected to a home automation system.

It\u0026rsquo;s a shame that Linux keyboard is still horribly broken by default (some may say it\u0026rsquo;s by design; no, it\u0026rsquo;s not).\nIt has been asked before, but most answers will point you to use xim, which will open another can of worms.

Some say it\u0026rsquo;ll the the digital renaissance; others claim it\u0026rsquo;s the best thing to ever happen to the web, after the browser itself.\nThis video summarizes well the sentiment:\nThis is wrong.\nTen years from now we\u0026rsquo;ll look back and realize how much the new gTLDs have hurt us.\nFirst, most of the new gTLDs add little or no value. I bet we could live another 50 years without a .ninja, a .soy, .fail, .florist, or .loans.\nOthers will proclaim that the new gTLDs are useful, and point to domains like .nyc, .london, or .website, as examples of the \u0026ldquo;democratization\u0026rdquo; promoted by the new categories.\nBut these will be the exception rather than the rule. In practice the new gTLDS will force brands to spend millions of dollars to protect against cybersquatters rushing to claim new brand-related domains, amongst other threats.\nBefore you had to register your brand across a handful of TLDs. Now you have 1,400 more to worry about. That\u0026rsquo;s like a whack-a-mole game, but you\u0026rsquo;re outnumbered by hundreds of moles for each hand you have.\nAnd yet, this is not my main concern. Brands got screwed and will spend a ton of money, while domain registrars will be laughing all the way to the bank. Whatever, life will be fine.\nMy concern is a different one: the new gTLDs will accelerate the demise of the URI.\nWe already lost users to search. It\u0026rsquo;s more convenient to type \u0026ldquo;Brand\u0026rdquo; on the browser and let your search engine do the rest than typing \u0026ldquo;brand.com\u0026rdquo;. And on mobile the URL is already hidden from the user, as if it were an irrelevant technical implementation detail. Same on Safari on desktop.\nBut now multiply this situation by thousands of gTLDs, and you\u0026rsquo;ll have the perfect Paradox of Choice. Is it a .com, a .net, .cc? Nops. Keep going friend.\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s add to the mix the fact that a) most of the mobile traffic is already coming from native apps, and b) Apple is pushing to bury the URI, and c) Google is replacing everything by its omni-search. And we\u0026rsquo;re not even talking about Siri or voice-activated search. This will result in a very different world. My prediction: thanks to the new gTLDs, mobile apps and commercial players will have even more control than today, and URLs will be demoted to second-class citizens. They will still be there, but buried somewhere in the sub-menus of your browser, or the API of your Chrome extensions. Just like IP addresses; you know it\u0026rsquo;s there somewhere, but nobody cares.\nIn the name of find-ability and ease of use, we\u0026rsquo;ll live in an URL-less world. And commercial entities will be rewarded and profit from your traffic.\nI\u0026rsquo;m sure that\u0026rsquo;s not the web that Sir Tim Berners-Lee envisioned 25 years ago.\n","permalink":"https://wrgms.com/gtlds-and-the-death-of-urls/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eUnless you\u0026rsquo;ve been living under a rock, you\u0026rsquo;ve read \u003cem\u003ead nauseum\u003c/em\u003e about the overly optimistic predictions for the new gTLDs.

Wrong.\nBut this time I was the one to blame.\nAfter solving the conflict with bash, I changed /etc/passwd user shell to /bin/bash. The only problem is that Synology wipes the system partition during firmware upgrades, so when I upgraded to DSM 4.1.2668, my custom `/bin/bash``was gone. Of course this locked me out of the system. No SSH, SCP or FTP. Great.\nAfter a few moments of panic, I remembered I still had the serial console. So I could put Linux in single user mode, and drop into recovery mode.\nSo if you\u0026rsquo;re ever in a similar situation, here\u0026rsquo;s how to fix it:\n1. First, you need a serial console.\n2. During U-Boot, press any key to cancel the automatic kernel boot (Hit any key to stop autoboot).\n3. Enter printenv to check the environment variables. Search for bootargs and bootm variables (they will be different on your system, so do NOT copy and paste from mine, unless you have a Synology DS212+ with the same DSM).\n4. Append reboot=cold,hard emergency init=/bin/sh to the end of bootargs variable. In my case, this is what I used:\nsetenv bootargs \u0026#39;console=ttyS0,115200 ip=off initrd=0x00800040,4M root=/dev/md0 rw syno_hw_version=DS212pv20 ihd_num=2 netif_num=1 esata_7042=1 reboot=cold,hard emergency init=/bin/sh\u0026#39; (again, your parameters will likely be different, so don\u0026rsquo;t copy and paste)\n5. Boot your kernel, with\nbootm F8080000 F8280000 Now your Synology should be happily botting in single user mode, ignoring /etc/passwd and dropping you to a plain shell. Do what you have to do to fix the system, and reboot.\nYou can also use these steps to recover your system partition from a crash or other problem.\n","permalink":"https://wrgms.com/entering-single-user-mode-on-a-synology/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/content/images/2013/01/synology.png\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hope this will be my last post about Synology for a while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter dealing for a few weeks with an \u003ca href=\"http://forum.synology.com/enu/viewtopic.php?f=221\u0026amp;t=59808\u0026amp;start=45#p232455\"\u003eunstable environment\u003c/a\u003e, then \u003ca href=\"/recovering-a-failed-synology-diskstation-ds2xx-serial\"\u003ehacking a serial console\u003c/a\u003e to troubleshoot, then \u003ca href=\"/synologys-secret-telnet-password/\"\u003ecracking the secret recovery telnet password\u003c/a\u003e just for fun, and finally solving the \u003ca href=\"http://serverfault.com/questions/458553/cant-log-in-via-ssh-to-any-accounts-set-to-use-bin-bash-as-a-default-shell/\"\u003eweird mistery\u003c/a\u003e of SSH \u003ca href=\"/reverse-engineering-synology-openssh\"\u003enot accepting /bin/bash as default shell\u003c/a\u003e, I thought I finally had a stable environment.

The user has to be called \u0026ldquo;root\u0026rdquo;.\nWHAAAT?\nThankfully, Synology uses a modified Linux distribution, so they publish the code under GPL.\nAfter a couple of hours looking at the OpenSSH source code, things became pretty obvious. Here\u0026rsquo;s the piece of code from their version of OpenSSH 5.8p1, file session.c:\nvoid do_child(Session *s, const char *command) { ... #ifdef MY_ABC_HERE char szValue[8]; int RunSSH = 0; SSH_CMD SSHCmd = REQ_UNKNOWN; if (1 == GetKeyValue(\u0026#34;/etc/synoinfo.conf\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;runssh\u0026#34;, szValue, sizeof(szValue))) { if (strcasecmp(szValue, \u0026#34;yes\u0026#34;) == 0) { RunSSH = 1; } } if (IsSFTPReq(command)){ SSHCmd = REQ_SFTP; } else if (IsRsyncReq(command)){ SSHCmd = REQ_RSYNC; } else if (IsTimebkpRequest(command)){ SSHCmd = REQ_TIMEBKP; } else if (RunSSH \u0026amp;amp;\u0026amp;amp; IsAllowShell(pw)){ SSHCmd = REQ_SHELL; } else { goto Err; } if (REQ_RSYNC == SSHCmd) { pw = SYNOChgValForRsync(pw); } if (!SSHCanLogin(SSHCmd, pw)) { goto Err; } goto Pass; Err: fprintf(stderr, \u0026#34;Permission denied, please try again.\\n\u0026#34;); exit(1); Pass: #endif /* MY_ABC_HERE */ ... } And here is the IsAllowShell(pw):\nstatic int IsAllowShell(const struct passwd *pw) { struct passwd *pUnPrivilege = NULL; char *szUserName = NULL; if (!pw || !pw-\u0026amp;gt;pw_name) { return 0; } szUserName = pw-\u0026amp;gt;pw_name; if(!strcmp(szUserName, \u0026#34;root\u0026#34;) || !strcmp(szUserName, \u0026#34;admin\u0026#34;)){ return 1; } if (NULL != (pUnPrivilege = getpwnam(szUserName))){ if (!strcmp(pUnPrivilege-\u0026amp;gt;pw_shell, \u0026#34;/bin/sh\u0026#34;) || !strcmp(pUnPrivilege-\u0026amp;gt;pw_shell, \u0026#34;/bin/ash\u0026#34;)) { return 1; } } return 0; } Basically synology created a heavily customized version of OpenSSH, including a handful of hacks - e.g., additional checking before accepting a login to see if the SSH service is enabled within the web interface, or stripping special chars (;, |, \u0026lsquo;) from rsync commands, and\u0026hellip; wait for it\u0026hellip; blocking anyone other than root or admin from using any shell other than /bin/sh or /bin/ash.\nOnce identified the cause, the fix was easy: just remove the call to IsAllowShell(). Cross-compile, upload to the NAS, reboot and voilà, regular users can now use bash normally.\nThe hardest part was to get cross-compiling working properly.

Or you simply don\u0026rsquo;t like the idea of having your port 23 open to the world for god-knows-how-long until a Synology tech support can look into your case.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ve probably tried telneting to your NAS. Maybe you\u0026rsquo;ve even tried opening the case and hacking the serial port, only to discover that you don\u0026rsquo;t have the root password. The DS Assistant password doesn\u0026rsquo;t work, and you exhausted all obvious guesses - blank, synopass, synology, password, admin, root, etc.\nWell, what about c12-0804? No, I didn\u0026rsquo;t make this up. This is today\u0026rsquo;s password.\nBut if you\u0026rsquo;re reading this a few days (or years) from now, too bad; it won\u0026rsquo;t work. Unless, of course, you wait until December 8th. Because the password repeats every year.\nBasically Synology hardcoded a modified login binary within the firmware that accepts an obfuscated password for root, which depends on the current date. (by the way, this isn\u0026rsquo;t the only thing Synology folks hardcoded in the firmware).\nThanks to GPL, Synology was forced to publish the original source code for the firmware. Based on the original correct_password.c code, I hacked a short snippet to generate the daily password.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the Synology Telnet password generator:\n#include \u0026amp;lt;stdlib.h\u0026amp;gt; #include \u0026amp;lt;time.h\u0026amp;gt; #include \u0026amp;lt;stdio.h\u0026amp;gt; void main() { struct timeval tvTime; struct tm tmOutput; gettimeofday(\u0026amp;amp;tvTime, 0); localtime_r(\u0026amp;amp;(tvTime.tv_sec), \u0026amp;amp;tmOutput); tmOutput.tm_mon += 1; printf(\u0026#34;password for today is: %x%02d-%02x%02d\\n\\n\u0026#34;, tmOutput.tm_mon, tmOutput.tm_mon, tmOutput.tm_mday, gcd(tmOutput.tm_mon, tmOutput.tm_mday)); } int gcd(int a, int b) { return (b?gcd(b,a%b):a); } Compile and run the code above with gcc. You can also use the excellent Codepad Repl.it to run the code online and get the password for today (no registration needed).\nBonus tip: if you\u0026rsquo;re curious how exactly the password is generated, here\u0026rsquo;s the algorithm:\n1st character = month in hexadecimal, lower case (1=Jan, \u0026hellip; , a=Oct, b=Nov, c=Dec) 2-3 = month in decimal, zero padded and starting in 1 (01, 02, 03, \u0026hellip;, 11, 12) 4 = dash 5-6 = day of the month in hex (01, 02 .., 0A, .., 1F) 7-8 = greatest common divisor between month and day, zero padded. This is always a number between 01 and 12. So, let\u0026rsquo;s say today is October 15, the password would be: a10-0f05 where a = month in hex, 10 = month in decimal, 0f = day in hex, 05 = greatest divisor between 10 and 15).\nIf you have trouble calculating the greatest common divisor (elementary math, anyone?), Wolfram Alpha is your friend.\nThis was tested on a Synology DS212+, with Marvell Kirkwood mv6282 chipset. It\u0026rsquo;s unlikely but still possible that different models use a different algorithm. YMMV, so always check the source code.\n[UPDATE 1: Several users reported that this works in many other models, including DS409, DS112j, etc. Please leave a comment with your model and firmware version.]\n[UPDATE 2: If it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work, it\u0026rsquo;s probably that your date is incorrect in the NAS. Per Patrick\u0026rsquo;s suggestion in the comments below, try \u0026ldquo;101-0101\u0026rdquo;, which is the password for Jan 01]\n","permalink":"https://wrgms.com/synologys-secret-telnet-password/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIf you have a Synology NAS and had some sort of disk crash in the past, you\u0026rsquo;ve probably encountered the famous \u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;Cannot format system partition\u0026rdquo;\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;Please configure your router to forward port 23 to DiskStation and contact Synology online support\u0026rdquo;\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, it sucks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt sucks even more when you know the disk is perfectly fine, and you still have hopes to recover your data.

The software is robust and much better than my old DroboFS, and the fact that it is entirely open source is a big plus.\nI recently upgraded the firmware to DSM 2661. Everything worked fine. For 12 hours. The next morning, the device was dead, with the blue blink of death).\nWas it the new firmware? Or maybe a disk crash? Who knows.\nI followed the basic tests recommended by Synology: remove both disks, turn it on and wait 30s for a long beep. Beeeeeep. Great, the motherboard is still functional. It also responded to ping and showed up on DS Assistant, so processor and ethernet are also working fine.\nThe Synology DS NAS is basically an embedded Linux box, using md + lvm for RAID. Nothing is proprietary, so I mounted the disks on my Linux desktop and spent a few more hours cloning and re-building the RAID using a spare disk. Life is good.\nTill\u0026hellip; it crashed again.\nThere was something wrong with the system partition, so I wanted to see inside the NAS, before the kernel finishes booting.\nThankfully, Synology folks already put a physical serial port in there. It\u0026rsquo;s not documented, but it\u0026rsquo;s not hard to find. You just have to open the case.\nDisclaimer: make sure you have backup! I am not responsible if you lose your data, void your warranty, burn down your house or kill your dog.\nStart by opening the case. Here\u0026rsquo;s a video with instructions [update: the original video is not available anymore, but here\u0026rsquo;s a similar one]. Be aware this may break the small internal hooks, and you\u0026rsquo;ll need to use tape or hot glue to put it back together (what\u0026rsquo;s wrong with manufacturers these days? What\u0026rsquo;s the problem with good old screws?) Inside the case, look for a 6-pin header, normally labeled JP2 (or COM1 on older models). The pins likely are: Pin Number Function Confirmed on Synology DS212+ \u0026nbsp; 13.3V 2GND 4TX 6RX Now connect the pins 2, 4 and 6 (respectively GNS, TX, RX) to your USB-TTL 3v3 cable (if using the FTDI cable from Adafruit, it\u0026rsquo;ll be 1-black, 5-yellow, 4-orange. Make sure you don\u0026rsquo;t short-circuit any of the pins. These male-female jumper wires could be useful. Open your preferred terminal program (under Win ExtraPutty is the best in town), set to 115200, disable xon/xoff, and you\u0026rsquo;re all set. Now you can turn on your DS, and see all the beauty of what\u0026rsquo;s going on under the hood:\n__ __ _ _ | \\/ | __ _ _ ____ _____| | | | |\\/| |/ _` | \u0026#39;__\\ \\ / / _ \\ | | | | | | (_| | | \\ V / __/ | | |_| |_|\\__,_|_| \\_/ \\___|_|_| _ _ ____ _ | | | | | __ ) ___ ___ | |_ | | | |___| _ \\ / _ \\ / _ \\| __| | |_| |___| |_) | (_) | (_) | |_ \\___/ |____/ \\___/ \\___/ \\__| ** LOADER ** ** MARVELL BOARD: Synology Disk Station LE U-Boot 1.1.4 (Dec 2 2011 - 15:56:02) Marvell version: 3.5.9 U-Boot code: 00600000 -\u0026amp;gt; 0067FFF0 BSS: -\u0026amp;gt; 0068B3D4 Soc: 88F6282 A1CPU running @ 2000Mhz L2 running @ 500Mhz SysClock = 500Mhz , TClock = 200Mhz DRAM (DDR3) CAS Latency = 7 tRP = 7 tRAS = 20 tRCD=7 DRAM CS[0] base 0x00000000 size 256MB DRAM CS[1] base 0x10000000 size 256MB DRAM Total size 512MB 16bit width Addresses 8M - 0M are saved for the U-Boot usage.

It\u0026rsquo;s sad to see so much work and love going nowhere. At least they were classy and wrote a candid and honest shutting-down post, and they\u0026rsquo;re even refunding users (!). That\u0026rsquo;s a level of integrity that you don\u0026rsquo;t see everyday in the startup world.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;ve never played Glitch, it\u0026rsquo;s now too late. The game world is now restricted to existing users, and everything will shut down on December 9th 2012. Here\u0026rsquo;s some videos to give you an idea of what you missed.\nI was part of the first wave of beta testers. Even though I\u0026rsquo;ve never spent much time playing, I remember how every detail was carefullyt thought through, and painstakenly executed. The videos don\u0026rsquo;t do justice to their attention to detail.\nBut, aside from the intrinsic beauty, the gameplay was dull. It was just a cute massive multiplayer social game. Maybe the cutest ever. But without a strong storytelling or any of the gamification tactics from other social gaming companies, there was no reason for you to keep coming back.\nIn a world of \u0026ldquo;Your crops are dying! Your friend Samantha just moved to a farm next door. Invite your friends to level up faster.\u0026rdquo;, it\u0026rsquo;s hard to keep users engaged these days.\nThis reminds me of the Steve Blank\u0026rsquo;s MVP stories. Do you need to develop a full game, with so many levels, intricate dialogues, dozens of non-playable characters, only to realize that your users aren\u0026rsquo;t coming back in the first place?\nCan\u0026rsquo;t you create a demo with a couple of levels and a handful of hard-coded NPCs, and invite your mom/sister/significant other to play? Just check how many times they come back (when you\u0026rsquo;re not looking). You\u0026rsquo;ll achieve the same conclusions, with 10% of the effort.\nOf course hindsight is a bitch \u0026ndash; or, like someone said on HN: \u0026quot;\u0026hellip;hindsight is a Glitch\u0026quot; :). Sometimes you can\u0026rsquo;t just hack an MVP together; you need a fully polished product. But I don\u0026rsquo;t think that\u0026rsquo;s the case here.\nIt seems to me they put too much effort on having a full product, and lost sight of the bigger picture. They repeated some of the same fatal mistakes others have done. For example, Lessons from Habitat outlines many of the same pitfalls, as seen by the creators of Lucasfilm in the mid-80\u0026rsquo;s. The entire paper is a great read, but one part that strikes me as relevant to this discussion:\n\u0026ldquo;While we find much of the work presently being done on elaborate interface technologies \u0026ndash; DataGloves, head-mounted displays, special-purpose rendering engines, and so on \u0026ndash; both exciting and promising, the almost mystical euphoria that currently seems to surround all this hardware is, in our opinion, both excessive and somewhat misplaced.\nWe can\u0026rsquo;t help having a nagging sense that it\u0026rsquo;s all a bit of a distraction from the really pressing issues.\n*At the core of our vision is the idea that cyberspace is necessarily a multiple-participant environment. It seems to us that the things that are important to the inhabitants of such an environment are the capabilities available to them, the characteristics of the other people they encounter there, and the ways these various participants can affect one another.\nBeyond a foundation set of communications capabilities, the details of the technology used to present this environment to its participants, while sexy and interesting, are of relatively peripheral concern.\u0026rdquo;\nKeep in mind the first Habitat was launched in 1986, almost 30 years ago, and ran in 64Kb on a Commodore64.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re now spoiled by Call Of Duty and hyper-realist NBA games. But there\u0026rsquo;s a point to be made that the success of an MMO game is not defined by its level of peripheral sophistication (be it design, cuteness, or head-mounted displays), but by the social experience, and how people interact with each other. Minecraft, with its blocky graphics and limited interactivity, is a prime example.\nGlitch isn\u0026rsquo;t alone in repeating these mistakes. Worlds Chat did the same two decades ago, being the first 3D world ever created. It was later replaced by The Palace. Later Philip Rosedale had his chance with Second Life, which exploded, then burst, and now is becoming cool again (and Philip is trying his hand again with High Fidelity).\nAnother issue with Glitch was its channel distribution. It\u0026rsquo;s challenging in 2012 to succeed with a web-only game, especially if you\u0026rsquo;re not anchored on Facebook. And Glitch was built in Flash (!), so it missed billions of 2-3 minutes slots of free time that people have when waiting for the train, bathroom, elevator.

Sony. HBGary Hack. FBI. Paypal, Visa \u0026amp; MasterCard. Mubarak. Occupy Wall Street. SOPA/PIPA.\nAnonymous has been busy for the past few years. It started as juvenile pranks on 4chan\u0026rsquo;s boards, but grew and became a powerful mechanism against oppressive governments and unscrupulous corporations.\nIts trajectory was beautifully captured in the documentary \u0026ldquo;We Are Legion: The Story of the Hacktivists\u0026rdquo;, that will be released later this year. I had the pleasure to watch the premiere in Austin during SXSW, and I must say - it\u0026rsquo;s f..ing brilliant. The movie is still in post-production, so the theatrical release may be slightly different.\nWe also participated in an exclusive interview with the film director \u0026ldquo;Brian Knappenberger\u0026rdquo;, who was joined on stage by former Anonymous member Gregg Housh and two special guests Anon behind masks: one from Austin, and another just called Anonymous9000, connecting via Skype from an undisclosed location (and using a robotic voice changer). It was a surreal experience.\nTogether they gave a passionate and fascinating perspective of the evolution of Anonymous, its internal workings, and the journey since 4Chan to the present day. They discussed how the group went after the Church of Scientology, why they hacked HBGary, discussed the release of confidential data of Sony customers, and how lately they\u0026rsquo;ve started to engage in social movements around freedom, Occupy Wall Street, the Arab Spring, and the support to Wikileaks\u0026rsquo; founder, Julian Assange.\nA few highlights of the session, in no particular order:\nsome Anons don\u0026rsquo;t agree with the dump of personal information (like in Sony\u0026rsquo;s case). But a few radical sub-groups - like Lulzsec - have a different opinion, and believe the press only pays attention when something concrete happens. Ironically, one of the most vocal supporters of dumping personal data was Sabu - which was revealed last week to be an FBI informant since June 2011. Conflict of interest, maybe?\nAnons in general don\u0026rsquo;t support attacking the press, as they believe in freedom of expression themselves (even when it is press against Anonymous). Some may disagree. Others simply don\u0026rsquo;t care; they\u0026rsquo;re in for the lulz, and accuse others of being moralfags. It\u0026rsquo;s these constant disagreements within Anonymous\u0026rsquo; anarchic structure that gave birth to dissidents, like Lulzsec.\n\u0026ldquo;Thousands of twenty-something socially awkward nerds got laid for the first time due to these movements and events in real life. Behind a mask, they all felt more comfortable in expressing themselves and talking with girls. We saw several marriages between Anons that met while protesting against the Church of Scientology and others\u0026rdquo;.\n\u0026ldquo;The DDoS attacks have just one objective: attract press. Whenever we have a message that we want the press to distribute, we DDoS someone so the press will publish the news that Anonymous attacked again, followed by what we wanted them to communicate. Otherwise we\u0026rsquo;d be just ignored. Look at SOPA/PIPA; we\u0026rsquo;ve been talking about this for years, and no one ever cared. Then we DDoS\u0026rsquo;d RIAA/MPAA/DoJ websites\u0026hellip; and the press showed up in full force overnight.\u0026rdquo;\nWatch the trailer here [YouTube].\nUpdate 2012-11-17: now also available for rental on Vimeo. This is the first time that Vimeo does movie rental. EDIT: Vimeo link is broken, but as of May 2025 it is now available on YouTube.\nUpdate 2012-10-17: it is opening in theatres this weekend. NY, LA, Houston, Canada, Rio de Janeiro and others. Check to see if your city is in the list. You can also pre-order the movie, starting on 10/30.

If you\u0026rsquo;re not one of the 12,000 people already using the service (that\u0026rsquo;s the number Andrea gave during the talk), well\u0026hellip; you should give it a try, because everyone is talking about it. Yeah, I live in the echo chamber, I know.\nGlancee, like its competitors Highlight, Sonar, Banjo, are all exploring the new niche of location social discovery - some sort of Match.com-meets-LinkedIn. Unproven territory, but sounds promising (albeit somewhat dystopian) to me. Andrea spoke about the current status of social discovery apps and the different approaches taken by each player. He also mentioned the incredible growth (hard to see 12,000 as incredible, but startup founders have to drink their own Kool-Aid), particularly with all the buzz around SXSW.\nBut to me the most interesting tidbit was the concept of monetizing the service via Spatial Analysis.\nHe didn\u0026rsquo;t elaborate much, so let me speculate a bit here. Consider that you have a device on your pocket that is connected to Facebook (i.e. knows everything about your attitudinal behavior - including Likes, affinity with brands, reach, friends). You have Glancee installed, and as such it is constantly broadcasting your current geolocation. Every. Single. Minute. Like Google Latitude, but with a Facebook social layer on top of it.\nNot only it knows who you are and what you like, but also where you\u0026rsquo;ve been, where you work, live, play, study, shop, your the preferred gas station, and countries you\u0026rsquo;ve travelled.\nAll this leads to a level of geospatial analysis never seen before, using all your social graph as an extra dimension. You could plot heatmaps showing location of people that liked your brand on FB, and use to optimize out-of-home media placement. Or monitor the consumers of a competitor brand when planning new physical stores. Basically it\u0026rsquo;s any marketer\u0026rsquo;s dream come true.\nOf course, it has just one small problem: it needs permission, and critical mass. You need tens of millions of users using the service, in order to have a meaningful representation.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why Andreas was so adamant when I asked him about his number one goal: \u0026ldquo;Growth. And fast\u0026rdquo;.\nUpdate 2012-05-04: it seems Facebook may agree with me here \u0026ndash; Facebook just announced they\u0026rsquo;re acquiring Glancee. I guess Andrea can scratch off \u0026ldquo;Growth\u0026rdquo; from his list.\n","permalink":"https://wrgms.com/glancee/","summary":"\u003ccenter\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Glancee at SXSW\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/content/images/2014/Feb/glancee.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/center\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy last session of SXSW Day 2 was with \u003ca href=\"http://andreavaccari.com/\"\u003eAndrea Vaccari\u003c/a\u003e, the CEO of the trendy location-based discovery startup \u003ca href=\"http://www.glancee.com/\"\u003eGlancee\u003c/a\u003e.

But despite recent progress with Content Network and YouTube, the marketing community still see the search giant as a way to drive conversion at the bottom of the funnel. In order to move to the next level, Google has to prove they can create emotional connections with consumers.\nEnter Project Re:Brief, just announced during SXSW.\nAccording to Aman Govil, Google\u0026rsquo;s Product Marketing Manager, the idea was to \u0026ldquo;re-imagine iconic campaigns of 4 classic global brands through the lenses of modern technology\u0026rdquo;. The project aims to be a benchmark of what is possible when you have the right idea and the perfect balance between creativity \u0026amp; technology.\nThe brands were carefully selected: Coca-Cola with Hilltop, Volvo with Drive it like you hate it, Avis We try harder, and Alka-Seltzer I can\u0026rsquo;t believe I ate the whole thing. The secret sauce was that they brought back from retirement the original creators of these 4 campaigns, and paired them with digital creatives, so they could re-imagine their original creations, leveraging today\u0026rsquo;s technology.\nIt was fascinating to see people like Harvey Gabor (Coca-Cola\u0026rsquo;s Hilltop, 1971) working with a bunch of twenty-something, and discovering how to use touch screens, mobile, realtime web.\nI had the opportunity to chat with Aman and Drew (the global creative director for the new campaigns) to understand how they pulled it together. Surprisingly, each project took just 2-3 months, and were executed with a relatively small budget (\u0026ldquo;Less than a TV spots\u0026rdquo;, told me Drew). Seems the advertisers were initially resistant to touch iconic pieces like Hilltop, but eventually understood the spirit of the project, and loved the opportunity to work with the original creators.\nWhat is even more fascinating is that not a single can of Coke or Alka-Seltzer was sold because this initiative. Google pulled this off not to help their clients sell more, but to help themseves. The target audience was marketers and agencies, hoping they would talk, comment, write blog posts. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t get more meta than this.\nCheck out more at www.projectrebrief.com, and look for the documentary later this year.\nUpdate 2012-06-22: the full documentary is now available on YouTube.\n","permalink":"https://wrgms.com/rebrief/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/content/images/2014/Feb/google_rebrief-1.png\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the past years Google has been trying to go beyond search, diversifying their revenue sources.

It took me some time to make it work like I wanted (keyboard, extensions, application menu, etc), but I\u0026rsquo;m quite happy with everything. Or almost everything.\nOne thing I enjoyed over the years was the ability to customize my keyboard shortcuts. I have dozens of shotcuts - to center windows on my screen, to open programs, start and stop Spotify, to run macros, to log in to my remote servers, and so on.\nOne of my handy shortcuts is \u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;F1\u0026gt; to open an xterm with superuser, and \u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;F2\u0026gt; for regular user. I use custom xterm profiles, so I can easily check if I\u0026rsquo;m running under a privileged context by looking at the color of the window.\nThis worked well for years under Ubuntu 14.04 and Gnome 3.20, but stopped working with the upgrade to Bionic Beaver. More specifically, \u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;F1\u0026gt; is now System Help, with no way to change it.\n\u0026ldquo;No problem\u0026rdquo;, I thought; this can be easily adjusted in System Settings.\nNops.\nI searched around, and found other folks with the same problem, but no solution.\nI then decided to dug into the source code, and discovered the improbable: Gnome devs decided the help was so important that it deserved its own unique, hardcoded, and immutable shortcut. If you want to reassign it, you\u0026rsquo;re out of luck.\nAccording to gnome-settings-daemon changelog:\n=============== Version 3.21.90 =============== ... Media keys: - Add Super+F1 as a hardcoded shortcut for launching Help ... REALLY? What\u0026rsquo;s wrong with a default icon in the toolbar, or maybe a popup window when you boot for the first time? Also, does anyone really care about reading the basic documentation for\u0026hellip; a windows manager?\nI wasn\u0026rsquo;t convinced yet, but a closer look at the source code confirmed my fear: there it was: (file /gnome-settings-daemon/blob/master/plugins/media-keys/shortcuts-list.h):\n{ HELP_KEY, NULL, N_(\u0026#34;Help\u0026#34;), \u0026#34;\u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;F1\u0026#34;, GSD_ACTION_MODE_LAUNCHER }, So if you\u0026rsquo;re really determined to regain control of your \u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;F1\u0026gt;, there\u0026rsquo;s only one solution: to recompile gnome-settings-daemon, and replace the gsd-media-keys plugin. Spoiler alert: I\u0026rsquo;m glad to report that my patch was successful, but beware: getting the right dependencies and recompiling Gnome is not an easy feat. Keep reading if you\u0026rsquo;re interested in doing the same:\nDownload and install Gnome Builder Click on \u0026ldquo;Clone\u0026rdquo;, select a local directory (e.g., ~/Projects/) and use the official repo at https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-settings-daemon Open xterm, and enter cd ~/Projects/gnome-settings-daemon; git checkout tags/GNOME_SETTINGS_DAEMON_3_28_1 (you can check your exact version with gnome-shell --version. Check all tags available with git tag -l) Install all dependencies. These were the ones missing in my system, but YMMV: apt install libcolord-dev \\ libgeocode-glib-dev \\ gnome-desktop3-data \\ libgnome-desktop-3-dev \\ libgweather-3-dev \\ libcanberra-gtk3-dev \\ libgeoclue-2-dev \\ libnotify-dev \\ libpulse-mainloop-glib0 \\ libpulse-dev \\ gobject-introspection \\ libupower-glib-dev \\ libpolkit-gobject-1-dev \\ libasound2-dev \\ libgudev-1.0-dev \\ libwacom-dev \\ libnss3-dev \\ libcups2-dev \\ libnm-dev Patch the source code by editing ~/Projects/gnome-settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/shortcuts-list.h, and add a comment in front of the offender, like below (for Gnome 3.28.1 it is in line 69): // disabled! // { HELP_KEY, NULL, N_(\u0026#34;Help\u0026#34;), \u0026#34;\u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;F1\u0026#34;, GSD_ACTION_MODE_LAUNCHER }, Click [Rebuild] button in the Builder UI to compile (note: you need to click Rebuild, and not Build). You may want to turn off the deprecation warnings by editing meson.build and adding '-Wno-deprecated-declarations' to test_cflags = [...]; (line 70). If you installed all the dependencies correctly, you should have no warnings nor errors. Find the compiled binaries. You\u0026rsquo;re looking specifically for the plugin gsd-media-keys, so it\u0026rsquo;ll likely be in the directory ~/.var/app/org.gnome.Builder/cache/gnome-builder/projects/gnome-settings-daemon/builds/default-host-HEAD/plugins/media-keys cd ~/.var/app/org.gnome.Builder/cache/gnome-builder/projects/gnome-settings-daemon/builds/default-host-HEAD/plugins/media-keys ~ cp ./gsd-media-keys ~/gsd-media-keys.patched Before proceeding, you may want to inspect your binary to confirm it successfully linked with shared libraries by using ldd ~/gsd-media-keys.patched. In my case I had problems finding libgsd.so, so I solved it by adding the path to ldconfig (although the correct solution would be to fix this in the build system): sudo sh -c \u0026#39;echo \u0026#34;# gnome-settings-daemon\\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gnome-settings-daemon-3.0/\\n\u0026#34; \u0026gt; /etc/ld.so.conf.d/gnome-settings-daemon.conf\u0026#39; sudo ldconfig You\u0026rsquo;re now ready to install the patched gsd-media-keys binary in your system: cd /usr/lib/gnome-settings-daemon/ sudo mv ~/gsd-media-keys.patched . sudo strip -s ./gsd-media-keys.patched sudo mv gsd-media-keys gsd-media-keys.orig sudo ln -s gsd-media-keys.patched gsd-media-keys Log out or reboot, and you\u0026rsquo;re done! If all goes well, your system now should be running the gsd-media-keys plugin without the \u0026lt;Super\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;F1\u0026gt; hardcoded, so you can reassign to anything you like.\nIf anything goes wrong and you can\u0026rsquo;t log in, don\u0026rsquo;t despair. Simply open a console terminal by using \u0026lt;Ctrl\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;Alt\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;F2\u0026gt; and restore your original gsd-media-keys binary by doing:\ncd /usr/lib/gnome-settings-daemon/ sudo rm gsd-media-keys sudo ln -s gsd-media-keys.orig gsd-media-keys Use \u0026lt;Ctrl\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;Alt\u0026gt;\u0026lt;F1\u0026gt; to go back to Gnome and log in again. You can then inspect /var/log/syslog to understand what went wrong (search for \u0026ldquo;media-keys\u0026rdquo;). It\u0026rsquo;s likely that you had problems with the dynamic libraries in step 8 above.\n","permalink":"https://wrgms.com/fixing-gnome-3-2x-hardcoded-superf1-shortcut/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eUbuntu 18.04 LTS is finally out, and with it you now have Gnome out of the box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve been using Gnome for several years, and have enjoyed its minimalism.

You may smile. But it will come…” [Henry Ford, 1940]\nFlying cars are not something new. The idea has been going around since the 19th century, even before the very first flight by Santos-Dumont (or Wright Brothers, depending on your bias). But it was The Jetsons who first brought the concept of flying cars to the masses. We grew up dreaming that one day we\u0026rsquo;d be able to get in our cars and fly straight to our destination - fast, safely, and traffic-free.\nThanks to Moore\u0026rsquo;s Law and the latest advances in engineering, we may be closer to flying cars than you think.\nAeroMobil is an innovative company from Slovakia, founded by Štefan Klein and Juraj Vaculik. Štefan, a well-known designer for Audi, Volkswagen and BMW, has been pursuing this idea for more than two decades. Juraj has a long and successful track record in advertising and as an investor. The two minds came together to create the company and make the dream a reality.\nDuring his talk at SXSW today, Juraj talked about the latest advances and their recent flying prototypes. As you can see on the two videos below, they made quite a progress between version 2.5 (early 2013) and 3.0 (late 2014).\nAeroMobil 2.5:\nAeroMobil 3.0: (note that Štefan himself test drives every prototype. He believes no one understand the machines better than him)\nDespite the progress, don\u0026rsquo;t expect to be driving - err.. flying - just yet. There are still several roadblocks (no pun intended) before mass adoption. They still need to figure out logistical challenges, like fueling stations, or grass strips next to roads for landing and take off. And change legislations, and define new testing procedures and certification. Or get people certified as pilots (yeah, don\u0026rsquo;t think your driver\u0026rsquo;s license will fly).\nBut with Google investing so heavily in self-driving cars, and SpaceX sending rockets to space, it\u0026rsquo;s not hard to imagine these efforts converging and eventually giving birth to self-driving flying cars. It might sound crazy at first, but there\u0026rsquo;s a good chance we\u0026rsquo;ll see it in our lifetime. AeroMobil may be in the exact spot that Paul Graham calls a Frighteningly Ambitious Startup Idea.\nCrazy? Yes.

With 800+ sessions this year, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to get overwhelmed. But get over your FOMO, and enjoy the serendipity. You will miss many good sessions, and that\u0026rsquo;s OK. The best talk will be that one you didn\u0026rsquo;t plan, and just entered because your first option was full.\nSpeaking of crowded sessions: always have a plan B. Your first option will likely be full, so having a second/third option is always important.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t go to panels. Ever. There\u0026rsquo;s hardly enough time for one person to convey a good idea in under 60 minutes. 4 or 5 becomes a festival of shallow sound bites. You already have Twitter for those.\nSeek geeky and obscure talks. The less buzzwords on the description, the better. Extra points if the talk is by someone who is actually making things - rather than people talking about those who made it. I saw some unbelievably good sessions in the past which had less 20 participants in the audience.\nBring an extra battery pack. Your phone will die midday, even if you have an iPhone 6 Plus. Pack some extra juice.\nPlan your commute time between sessions. Some venues are 2 miles away from Austin Convention Center, and shuttles may take 15-30 min door-to-door. Try Lyft/Uber, or pedicabs. Or you can be ultra-hipster and apply for a loaner Boosted Board. I already secured mine!\nDriving is usually a bad idea. Parking is expensive, and you may want to have a beer or two (or six or ten). Get an Uber/Lyft, or use the official shuttles, but be prepared to spend one hour each way. And remind yourself next time to book your ticket the exact minute they go on sale, and enjoy the convenience of a hotel in walking distance.\nHave a good breakfast. You won\u0026rsquo;t eat much during the day, and you\u0026rsquo;re probably still recovering from last night.\nRSVPs are usually useless. Most of the parties don\u0026rsquo;t require RSVP, and use it just to collect email addresses. And the ones that do are not the ones you see on blogs. [EDIT: this used to be true, but it\u0026rsquo;s now starting to change. Many parties are now respecting RSVPs, and even many of the talks in the official program started to require reservation, so play safe and do your homework.]\nRemember: SXSW is a marathon, not a sprint. It\u0026rsquo;s 5 full days (double if you do Music/Film), so take time to enjoy yourself. It\u0026rsquo;s Spring, and there\u0026rsquo;s no better time to be in Austin.

The requirements are:\nMust be able to listen continuously Run on embedded ARM processors (particuarly Raspberry Pi and BeagleBone Black) Good accuracy on a limited set of words (English only) Decent performance, particularly on low-power CPUs My first thought was to use Google Speech API. The accuracy is great, and it\u0026rsquo;s reasonably fast. But it is also limited to only 50 calls per day, so it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t satisfy requirement #1. And I don\u0026rsquo;t like the idea of streaming all of my personal conversations to anyone. It\u0026rsquo;s already enough to have NSA listening to my phone calls\u0026hellip;\n(maybe it\u0026rsquo;s an option for the future, when implementing something with a physical push-button, like a Star Trek communicator device)\nSiriProxy is another neat hack, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work with iOS7/8 anymore. Apple will soon offer an official interface to Siri via its HomeKit program, but it\u0026rsquo;ll only work with licensed hardware. Likely not an option for hackers and personal projects.\nAfter some research, I found CMUSphinx project, which seems to be the best project in the area of voice recognition. PocketSphinx toolkit is the version you want for embedded CPUs, as it\u0026rsquo;s pure C, and rather portable.\nThe documentation is not very friendly, but once you get it going, it works well.\nThe first step is to download and install SphinxBase, followed by PocketSphinx. The README has instructions to compile and install, but it\u0026rsquo;s the basic\n./configure make make install By default it\u0026rsquo;ll install binaries to /usr/local/bin, and language models to /usr/local/share. Make sure you have swig and alsa drivers installed before starting (apt-get install swig alsa-base alsa-utils).\nOnce installed, you need to figure out which dictionary model you want to use. Just for testing, I created a dictionary with 106 words, based on the old Logo language (remember the Logo turtle?), like forward, backward, turn right, turn left, etc.\nBefore you can start training PocketSphinx, you\u0026rsquo;ll need an acoustic model. Sadly, the speech corpus (i.e., audio files with spoken words) used to train the models are usually closed source. So either you spend a couple of hours recording the voices (or using an4/Voxforge) to train your own model, or you\u0026rsquo;ll skip this entirely and just use some of the built-in models, accepting lower accuracy. Given my limited number of words in the dictionary, I decided to go with built in acoustic models.\nNext, you need to describe your Language Model - the words, grammar, and frequency of words that you want to recognize. This tutorial has more details. If you\u0026rsquo;re in a hurry and just want to get PocketSphinx going with a dictionary for your pre-defined words, save yourself some trouble and use the online lmtool. This webservice will allow you to upload your dictionary file (a simple ASCII file, with one sentence or word per line), and it\u0026rsquo;ll generate all the language models you need to run PocketSphinx.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a sample of my dictionary file:\nannounce answer ask back clipboard color copy count ... sentence set space square root stamp wait wait until when who word If you want to play with this dictionary, download these files here, and run:\npocketsphinx_continuous -lm lm/logo.lm -dict lm/logo.dic (note: if pocketsphinx is stuck at READY, it\u0026rsquo;s probably listening to the wrong hw device. Check where is the microphone attached via cat /proc/asound/cards, and add -adcdev plughw:X,0 to the line above, replacing X by the hardware id of your microphone).\npocketsphinx_continuous -lm lm/logo.lm -dict lm/logo.dic -adcdev plughw:2,0 Smartphones use all sorts of tricks to cancel the background noise, but that requires special hardware, so you\u0026rsquo;ll need a reasonable quiet environment. Otherwise the accuracy will suffer, depending on how large your dictionary is.\nAs you would expect, smaller dictionaries have much better accuracy. With a 100-word, I got 60-70% correct. After I reduced to a simple 15-words dictionary, I got virtually 100% match rate, even with some background noise and a non-American accent. Certainly enough for my projects.\nNext up: running this on a Raspberry Pi, installing a decent openair microphone, and testing overall performance when connected to a home automation system.

It\u0026rsquo;s a shame that Linux keyboard is still horribly broken by default (some may say it\u0026rsquo;s by design; no, it\u0026rsquo;s not).\nIt has been asked before, but most answers will point you to use xim, which will open another can of worms.

Some say it\u0026rsquo;ll the the digital renaissance; others claim it\u0026rsquo;s the best thing to ever happen to the web, after the browser itself.\nThis video summarizes well the sentiment:\nThis is wrong.\nTen years from now we\u0026rsquo;ll look back and realize how much the new gTLDs have hurt us.\nFirst, most of the new gTLDs add little or no value. I bet we could live another 50 years without a .ninja, a .soy, .fail, .florist, or .loans.\nOthers will proclaim that the new gTLDs are useful, and point to domains like .nyc, .london, or .website, as examples of the \u0026ldquo;democratization\u0026rdquo; promoted by the new categories.\nBut these will be the exception rather than the rule. In practice the new gTLDS will force brands to spend millions of dollars to protect against cybersquatters rushing to claim new brand-related domains, amongst other threats.\nBefore you had to register your brand across a handful of TLDs. Now you have 1,400 more to worry about. That\u0026rsquo;s like a whack-a-mole game, but you\u0026rsquo;re outnumbered by hundreds of moles for each hand you have.\nAnd yet, this is not my main concern. Brands got screwed and will spend a ton of money, while domain registrars will be laughing all the way to the bank. Whatever, life will be fine.\nMy concern is a different one: the new gTLDs will accelerate the demise of the URI.\nWe already lost users to search. It\u0026rsquo;s more convenient to type \u0026ldquo;Brand\u0026rdquo; on the browser and let your search engine do the rest than typing \u0026ldquo;brand.com\u0026rdquo;. And on mobile the URL is already hidden from the user, as if it were an irrelevant technical implementation detail. Same on Safari on desktop.\nBut now multiply this situation by thousands of gTLDs, and you\u0026rsquo;ll have the perfect Paradox of Choice. Is it a .com, a .net, .cc? Nops. Keep going friend.\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s add to the mix the fact that a) most of the mobile traffic is already coming from native apps, and b) Apple is pushing to bury the URI, and c) Google is replacing everything by its omni-search. And we\u0026rsquo;re not even talking about Siri or voice-activated search. This will result in a very different world. My prediction: thanks to the new gTLDs, mobile apps and commercial players will have even more control than today, and URLs will be demoted to second-class citizens. They will still be there, but buried somewhere in the sub-menus of your browser, or the API of your Chrome extensions. Just like IP addresses; you know it\u0026rsquo;s there somewhere, but nobody cares.\nIn the name of find-ability and ease of use, we\u0026rsquo;ll live in an URL-less world. And commercial entities will be rewarded and profit from your traffic.\nI\u0026rsquo;m sure that\u0026rsquo;s not the web that Sir Tim Berners-Lee envisioned 25 years ago.\n","permalink":"https://wrgms.com/gtlds-and-the-death-of-urls/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eUnless you\u0026rsquo;ve been living under a rock, you\u0026rsquo;ve read \u003cem\u003ead nauseum\u003c/em\u003e about the overly optimistic predictions for the new gTLDs.

Wrong.\nBut this time I was the one to blame.\nAfter solving the conflict with bash, I changed /etc/passwd user shell to /bin/bash. The only problem is that Synology wipes the system partition during firmware upgrades, so when I upgraded to DSM 4.1.2668, my custom `/bin/bash``was gone. Of course this locked me out of the system. No SSH, SCP or FTP. Great.\nAfter a few moments of panic, I remembered I still had the serial console. So I could put Linux in single user mode, and drop into recovery mode.\nSo if you\u0026rsquo;re ever in a similar situation, here\u0026rsquo;s how to fix it:\n1. First, you need a serial console.\n2. During U-Boot, press any key to cancel the automatic kernel boot (Hit any key to stop autoboot).\n3. Enter printenv to check the environment variables. Search for bootargs and bootm variables (they will be different on your system, so do NOT copy and paste from mine, unless you have a Synology DS212+ with the same DSM).\n4. Append reboot=cold,hard emergency init=/bin/sh to the end of bootargs variable. In my case, this is what I used:\nsetenv bootargs \u0026#39;console=ttyS0,115200 ip=off initrd=0x00800040,4M root=/dev/md0 rw syno_hw_version=DS212pv20 ihd_num=2 netif_num=1 esata_7042=1 reboot=cold,hard emergency init=/bin/sh\u0026#39; (again, your parameters will likely be different, so don\u0026rsquo;t copy and paste)\n5. Boot your kernel, with\nbootm F8080000 F8280000 Now your Synology should be happily botting in single user mode, ignoring /etc/passwd and dropping you to a plain shell. Do what you have to do to fix the system, and reboot.\nYou can also use these steps to recover your system partition from a crash or other problem.\n","permalink":"https://wrgms.com/entering-single-user-mode-on-a-synology/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/content/images/2013/01/synology.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hope this will be my last post about Synology for a while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter dealing for a few weeks with an \u003ca href=\"http://forum.synology.com/enu/viewtopic.php?f=221\u0026amp;t=59808\u0026amp;start=45#p232455\"\u003eunstable environment\u003c/a\u003e, then \u003ca href=\"/recovering-a-failed-synology-diskstation-ds2xx-serial\"\u003ehacking a serial console\u003c/a\u003e to troubleshoot, then \u003ca href=\"/synologys-secret-telnet-password/\"\u003ecracking the secret recovery telnet password\u003c/a\u003e just for fun, and finally solving the \u003ca href=\"http://serverfault.com/questions/458553/cant-log-in-via-ssh-to-any-accounts-set-to-use-bin-bash-as-a-default-shell/\"\u003eweird mistery\u003c/a\u003e of SSH \u003ca href=\"/reverse-engineering-synology-openssh\"\u003enot accepting /bin/bash as default shell\u003c/a\u003e, I thought I finally had a stable environment.

The user has to be called \u0026ldquo;root\u0026rdquo;.\nWHAAAT?\nThankfully, Synology uses a modified Linux distribution, so they publish the code under GPL.\nAfter a couple of hours looking at the OpenSSH source code, things became pretty obvious. Here\u0026rsquo;s the piece of code from their version of OpenSSH 5.8p1, file session.c:\nvoid do_child(Session *s, const char *command) { ... #ifdef MY_ABC_HERE char szValue[8]; int RunSSH = 0; SSH_CMD SSHCmd = REQ_UNKNOWN; if (1 == GetKeyValue(\u0026#34;/etc/synoinfo.conf\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;runssh\u0026#34;, szValue, sizeof(szValue))) { if (strcasecmp(szValue, \u0026#34;yes\u0026#34;) == 0) { RunSSH = 1; } } if (IsSFTPReq(command)){ SSHCmd = REQ_SFTP; } else if (IsRsyncReq(command)){ SSHCmd = REQ_RSYNC; } else if (IsTimebkpRequest(command)){ SSHCmd = REQ_TIMEBKP; } else if (RunSSH \u0026amp;amp;\u0026amp;amp; IsAllowShell(pw)){ SSHCmd = REQ_SHELL; } else { goto Err; } if (REQ_RSYNC == SSHCmd) { pw = SYNOChgValForRsync(pw); } if (!SSHCanLogin(SSHCmd, pw)) { goto Err; } goto Pass; Err: fprintf(stderr, \u0026#34;Permission denied, please try again.\\n\u0026#34;); exit(1); Pass: #endif /* MY_ABC_HERE */ ... } And here is the IsAllowShell(pw):\nstatic int IsAllowShell(const struct passwd *pw) { struct passwd *pUnPrivilege = NULL; char *szUserName = NULL; if (!pw || !pw-\u0026amp;gt;pw_name) { return 0; } szUserName = pw-\u0026amp;gt;pw_name; if(!strcmp(szUserName, \u0026#34;root\u0026#34;) || !strcmp(szUserName, \u0026#34;admin\u0026#34;)){ return 1; } if (NULL != (pUnPrivilege = getpwnam(szUserName))){ if (!strcmp(pUnPrivilege-\u0026amp;gt;pw_shell, \u0026#34;/bin/sh\u0026#34;) || !strcmp(pUnPrivilege-\u0026amp;gt;pw_shell, \u0026#34;/bin/ash\u0026#34;)) { return 1; } } return 0; } Basically synology created a heavily customized version of OpenSSH, including a handful of hacks - e.g., additional checking before accepting a login to see if the SSH service is enabled within the web interface, or stripping special chars (;, |, \u0026lsquo;) from rsync commands, and\u0026hellip; wait for it\u0026hellip; blocking anyone other than root or admin from using any shell other than /bin/sh or /bin/ash.\nOnce identified the cause, the fix was easy: just remove the call to IsAllowShell(). Cross-compile, upload to the NAS, reboot and voilà, regular users can now use bash normally.\nThe hardest part was to get cross-compiling working properly.

Or you simply don\u0026rsquo;t like the idea of having your port 23 open to the world for god-knows-how-long until a Synology tech support can look into your case.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ve probably tried telneting to your NAS. Maybe you\u0026rsquo;ve even tried opening the case and hacking the serial port, only to discover that you don\u0026rsquo;t have the root password. The DS Assistant password doesn\u0026rsquo;t work, and you exhausted all obvious guesses - blank, synopass, synology, password, admin, root, etc.\nWell, what about c12-0804? No, I didn\u0026rsquo;t make this up. This is today\u0026rsquo;s password.\nBut if you\u0026rsquo;re reading this a few days (or years) from now, too bad; it won\u0026rsquo;t work. Unless, of course, you wait until December 8th. Because the password repeats every year.\nBasically Synology hardcoded a modified login binary within the firmware that accepts an obfuscated password for root, which depends on the current date. (by the way, this isn\u0026rsquo;t the only thing Synology folks hardcoded in the firmware).\nThanks to GPL, Synology was forced to publish the original source code for the firmware. Based on the original correct_password.c code, I hacked a short snippet to generate the daily password.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the Synology Telnet password generator:\n#include \u0026amp;lt;stdlib.h\u0026amp;gt; #include \u0026amp;lt;time.h\u0026amp;gt; #include \u0026amp;lt;stdio.h\u0026amp;gt; void main() { struct timeval tvTime; struct tm tmOutput; gettimeofday(\u0026amp;amp;tvTime, 0); localtime_r(\u0026amp;amp;(tvTime.tv_sec), \u0026amp;amp;tmOutput); tmOutput.tm_mon += 1; printf(\u0026#34;password for today is: %x%02d-%02x%02d\\n\\n\u0026#34;, tmOutput.tm_mon, tmOutput.tm_mon, tmOutput.tm_mday, gcd(tmOutput.tm_mon, tmOutput.tm_mday)); } int gcd(int a, int b) { return (b?gcd(b,a%b):a); } Compile and run the code above with gcc. You can also use the excellent Codepad Repl.it to run the code online and get the password for today (no registration needed).\nBonus tip: if you\u0026rsquo;re curious how exactly the password is generated, here\u0026rsquo;s the algorithm:\n1st character = month in hexadecimal, lower case (1=Jan, \u0026hellip; , a=Oct, b=Nov, c=Dec) 2-3 = month in decimal, zero padded and starting in 1 (01, 02, 03, \u0026hellip;, 11, 12) 4 = dash 5-6 = day of the month in hex (01, 02 .., 0A, .., 1F) 7-8 = greatest common divisor between month and day, zero padded. This is always a number between 01 and 12. So, let\u0026rsquo;s say today is October 15, the password would be: a10-0f05 where a = month in hex, 10 = month in decimal, 0f = day in hex, 05 = greatest divisor between 10 and 15).\nIf you have trouble calculating the greatest common divisor (elementary math, anyone?), Wolfram Alpha is your friend.\nThis was tested on a Synology DS212+, with Marvell Kirkwood mv6282 chipset. It\u0026rsquo;s unlikely but still possible that different models use a different algorithm. YMMV, so always check the source code.\n[UPDATE 1: Several users reported that this works in many other models, including DS409, DS112j, etc. Please leave a comment with your model and firmware version.]\n[UPDATE 2: If it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work, it\u0026rsquo;s probably that your date is incorrect in the NAS. Per Patrick\u0026rsquo;s suggestion in the comments below, try \u0026ldquo;101-0101\u0026rdquo;, which is the password for Jan 01]\n","permalink":"https://wrgms.com/synologys-secret-telnet-password/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIf you have a Synology NAS and had some sort of disk crash in the past, you\u0026rsquo;ve probably encountered the famous \u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;Cannot format system partition\u0026rdquo;\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;Please configure your router to forward port 23 to DiskStation and contact Synology online support\u0026rdquo;\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, it sucks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt sucks even more when you know the disk is perfectly fine, and you still have hopes to recover your data.

The software is robust and much better than my old DroboFS, and the fact that it is entirely open source is a big plus.\nI recently upgraded the firmware to DSM 2661. Everything worked fine. For 12 hours. The next morning, the device was dead, with the blue blink of death).\nWas it the new firmware? Or maybe a disk crash? Who knows.\nI followed the basic tests recommended by Synology: remove both disks, turn it on and wait 30s for a long beep. Beeeeeep. Great, the motherboard is still functional. It also responded to ping and showed up on DS Assistant, so processor and ethernet are also working fine.\nThe Synology DS NAS is basically an embedded Linux box, using md + lvm for RAID. Nothing is proprietary, so I mounted the disks on my Linux desktop and spent a few more hours cloning and re-building the RAID using a spare disk. Life is good.\nTill\u0026hellip; it crashed again.\nThere was something wrong with the system partition, so I wanted to see inside the NAS, before the kernel finishes booting.\nThankfully, Synology folks already put a physical serial port in there. It\u0026rsquo;s not documented, but it\u0026rsquo;s not hard to find. You just have to open the case.\nDisclaimer: make sure you have backup! I am not responsible if you lose your data, void your warranty, burn down your house or kill your dog.\nStart by opening the case. Here\u0026rsquo;s a video with instructions [update: the original video is not available anymore, but here\u0026rsquo;s a similar one]. Be aware this may break the small internal hooks, and you\u0026rsquo;ll need to use tape or hot glue to put it back together (what\u0026rsquo;s wrong with manufacturers these days? What\u0026rsquo;s the problem with good old screws?) Inside the case, look for a 6-pin header, normally labeled JP2 (or COM1 on older models). The pins likely are: Pin Number Function Confirmed on Synology DS212+ \u0026nbsp; 13.3V 2GND 4TX 6RX Now connect the pins 2, 4 and 6 (respectively GNS, TX, RX) to your USB-TTL 3v3 cable (if using the FTDI cable from Adafruit, it\u0026rsquo;ll be 1-black, 5-yellow, 4-orange. Make sure you don\u0026rsquo;t short-circuit any of the pins. These male-female jumper wires could be useful. Open your preferred terminal program (under Win ExtraPutty is the best in town), set to 115200, disable xon/xoff, and you\u0026rsquo;re all set. Now you can turn on your DS, and see all the beauty of what\u0026rsquo;s going on under the hood:\n__ __ _ _ | \\/ | __ _ _ ____ _____| | | | |\\/| |/ _` | \u0026#39;__\\ \\ / / _ \\ | | | | | | (_| | | \\ V / __/ | | |_| |_|\\__,_|_| \\_/ \\___|_|_| _ _ ____ _ | | | | | __ ) ___ ___ | |_ | | | |___| _ \\ / _ \\ / _ \\| __| | |_| |___| |_) | (_) | (_) | |_ \\___/ |____/ \\___/ \\___/ \\__| ** LOADER ** ** MARVELL BOARD: Synology Disk Station LE U-Boot 1.1.4 (Dec 2 2011 - 15:56:02) Marvell version: 3.5.9 U-Boot code: 00600000 -\u0026amp;gt; 0067FFF0 BSS: -\u0026amp;gt; 0068B3D4 Soc: 88F6282 A1CPU running @ 2000Mhz L2 running @ 500Mhz SysClock = 500Mhz , TClock = 200Mhz DRAM (DDR3) CAS Latency = 7 tRP = 7 tRAS = 20 tRCD=7 DRAM CS[0] base 0x00000000 size 256MB DRAM CS[1] base 0x10000000 size 256MB DRAM Total size 512MB 16bit width Addresses 8M - 0M are saved for the U-Boot usage.

It\u0026rsquo;s sad to see so much work and love going nowhere. At least they were classy and wrote a candid and honest shutting-down post, and they\u0026rsquo;re even refunding users (!). That\u0026rsquo;s a level of integrity that you don\u0026rsquo;t see everyday in the startup world.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;ve never played Glitch, it\u0026rsquo;s now too late. The game world is now restricted to existing users, and everything will shut down on December 9th 2012. Here\u0026rsquo;s some videos to give you an idea of what you missed.\nI was part of the first wave of beta testers. Even though I\u0026rsquo;ve never spent much time playing, I remember how every detail was carefullyt thought through, and painstakenly executed. The videos don\u0026rsquo;t do justice to their attention to detail.\nBut, aside from the intrinsic beauty, the gameplay was dull. It was just a cute massive multiplayer social game. Maybe the cutest ever. But without a strong storytelling or any of the gamification tactics from other social gaming companies, there was no reason for you to keep coming back.\nIn a world of \u0026ldquo;Your crops are dying! Your friend Samantha just moved to a farm next door. Invite your friends to level up faster.\u0026rdquo;, it\u0026rsquo;s hard to keep users engaged these days.\nThis reminds me of the Steve Blank\u0026rsquo;s MVP stories. Do you need to develop a full game, with so many levels, intricate dialogues, dozens of non-playable characters, only to realize that your users aren\u0026rsquo;t coming back in the first place?\nCan\u0026rsquo;t you create a demo with a couple of levels and a handful of hard-coded NPCs, and invite your mom/sister/significant other to play? Just check how many times they come back (when you\u0026rsquo;re not looking). You\u0026rsquo;ll achieve the same conclusions, with 10% of the effort.\nOf course hindsight is a bitch \u0026ndash; or, like someone said on HN: \u0026quot;\u0026hellip;hindsight is a Glitch\u0026quot; :). Sometimes you can\u0026rsquo;t just hack an MVP together; you need a fully polished product. But I don\u0026rsquo;t think that\u0026rsquo;s the case here.\nIt seems to me they put too much effort on having a full product, and lost sight of the bigger picture. They repeated some of the same fatal mistakes others have done. For example, Lessons from Habitat outlines many of the same pitfalls, as seen by the creators of Lucasfilm in the mid-80\u0026rsquo;s. The entire paper is a great read, but one part that strikes me as relevant to this discussion:\n\u0026ldquo;While we find much of the work presently being done on elaborate interface technologies \u0026ndash; DataGloves, head-mounted displays, special-purpose rendering engines, and so on \u0026ndash; both exciting and promising, the almost mystical euphoria that currently seems to surround all this hardware is, in our opinion, both excessive and somewhat misplaced.\nWe can\u0026rsquo;t help having a nagging sense that it\u0026rsquo;s all a bit of a distraction from the really pressing issues.\n*At the core of our vision is the idea that cyberspace is necessarily a multiple-participant environment. It seems to us that the things that are important to the inhabitants of such an environment are the capabilities available to them, the characteristics of the other people they encounter there, and the ways these various participants can affect one another.\nBeyond a foundation set of communications capabilities, the details of the technology used to present this environment to its participants, while sexy and interesting, are of relatively peripheral concern.\u0026rdquo;\nKeep in mind the first Habitat was launched in 1986, almost 30 years ago, and ran in 64Kb on a Commodore64.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re now spoiled by Call Of Duty and hyper-realist NBA games. But there\u0026rsquo;s a point to be made that the success of an MMO game is not defined by its level of peripheral sophistication (be it design, cuteness, or head-mounted displays), but by the social experience, and how people interact with each other. Minecraft, with its blocky graphics and limited interactivity, is a prime example.\nGlitch isn\u0026rsquo;t alone in repeating these mistakes. Worlds Chat did the same two decades ago, being the first 3D world ever created. It was later replaced by The Palace. Later Philip Rosedale had his chance with Second Life, which exploded, then burst, and now is becoming cool again (and Philip is trying his hand again with High Fidelity).\nAnother issue with Glitch was its channel distribution. It\u0026rsquo;s challenging in 2012 to succeed with a web-only game, especially if you\u0026rsquo;re not anchored on Facebook. And Glitch was built in Flash (!), so it missed billions of 2-3 minutes slots of free time that people have when waiting for the train, bathroom, elevator.

Sony. HBGary Hack. FBI. Paypal, Visa \u0026amp; MasterCard. Mubarak. Occupy Wall Street. SOPA/PIPA.\nAnonymous has been busy for the past few years. It started as juvenile pranks on 4chan\u0026rsquo;s boards, but grew and became a powerful mechanism against oppressive governments and unscrupulous corporations.\nIts trajectory was beautifully captured in the documentary \u0026ldquo;We Are Legion: The Story of the Hacktivists\u0026rdquo;, that will be released later this year. I had the pleasure to watch the premiere in Austin during SXSW, and I must say - it\u0026rsquo;s f..ing brilliant. The movie is still in post-production, so the theatrical release may be slightly different.\nWe also participated in an exclusive interview with the film director \u0026ldquo;Brian Knappenberger\u0026rdquo;, who was joined on stage by former Anonymous member Gregg Housh and two special guests Anon behind masks: one from Austin, and another just called Anonymous9000, connecting via Skype from an undisclosed location (and using a robotic voice changer). It was a surreal experience.\nTogether they gave a passionate and fascinating perspective of the evolution of Anonymous, its internal workings, and the journey since 4Chan to the present day. They discussed how the group went after the Church of Scientology, why they hacked HBGary, discussed the release of confidential data of Sony customers, and how lately they\u0026rsquo;ve started to engage in social movements around freedom, Occupy Wall Street, the Arab Spring, and the support to Wikileaks\u0026rsquo; founder, Julian Assange.\nA few highlights of the session, in no particular order:\nsome Anons don\u0026rsquo;t agree with the dump of personal information (like in Sony\u0026rsquo;s case). But a few radical sub-groups - like Lulzsec - have a different opinion, and believe the press only pays attention when something concrete happens. Ironically, one of the most vocal supporters of dumping personal data was Sabu - which was revealed last week to be an FBI informant since June 2011. Conflict of interest, maybe?\nAnons in general don\u0026rsquo;t support attacking the press, as they believe in freedom of expression themselves (even when it is press against Anonymous). Some may disagree. Others simply don\u0026rsquo;t care; they\u0026rsquo;re in for the lulz, and accuse others of being moralfags. It\u0026rsquo;s these constant disagreements within Anonymous\u0026rsquo; anarchic structure that gave birth to dissidents, like Lulzsec.\n\u0026ldquo;Thousands of twenty-something socially awkward nerds got laid for the first time due to these movements and events in real life. Behind a mask, they all felt more comfortable in expressing themselves and talking with girls. We saw several marriages between Anons that met while protesting against the Church of Scientology and others\u0026rdquo;.\n\u0026ldquo;The DDoS attacks have just one objective: attract press. Whenever we have a message that we want the press to distribute, we DDoS someone so the press will publish the news that Anonymous attacked again, followed by what we wanted them to communicate. Otherwise we\u0026rsquo;d be just ignored. Look at SOPA/PIPA; we\u0026rsquo;ve been talking about this for years, and no one ever cared. Then we DDoS\u0026rsquo;d RIAA/MPAA/DoJ websites\u0026hellip; and the press showed up in full force overnight.\u0026rdquo;\nWatch the trailer here [YouTube].\nUpdate 2012-11-17: now also available for rental on Vimeo. This is the first time that Vimeo does movie rental. EDIT: Vimeo link is broken, but as of May 2025 it is now available on YouTube.\nUpdate 2012-10-17: it is opening in theatres this weekend. NY, LA, Houston, Canada, Rio de Janeiro and others. Check to see if your city is in the list. You can also pre-order the movie, starting on 10/30.

If you\u0026rsquo;re not one of the 12,000 people already using the service (that\u0026rsquo;s the number Andrea gave during the talk), well\u0026hellip; you should give it a try, because everyone is talking about it. Yeah, I live in the echo chamber, I know.\nGlancee, like its competitors Highlight, Sonar, Banjo, are all exploring the new niche of location social discovery - some sort of Match.com-meets-LinkedIn. Unproven territory, but sounds promising (albeit somewhat dystopian) to me. Andrea spoke about the current status of social discovery apps and the different approaches taken by each player. He also mentioned the incredible growth (hard to see 12,000 as incredible, but startup founders have to drink their own Kool-Aid), particularly with all the buzz around SXSW.\nBut to me the most interesting tidbit was the concept of monetizing the service via Spatial Analysis.\nHe didn\u0026rsquo;t elaborate much, so let me speculate a bit here. Consider that you have a device on your pocket that is connected to Facebook (i.e. knows everything about your attitudinal behavior - including Likes, affinity with brands, reach, friends). You have Glancee installed, and as such it is constantly broadcasting your current geolocation. Every. Single. Minute. Like Google Latitude, but with a Facebook social layer on top of it.\nNot only it knows who you are and what you like, but also where you\u0026rsquo;ve been, where you work, live, play, study, shop, your the preferred gas station, and countries you\u0026rsquo;ve travelled.\nAll this leads to a level of geospatial analysis never seen before, using all your social graph as an extra dimension. You could plot heatmaps showing location of people that liked your brand on FB, and use to optimize out-of-home media placement. Or monitor the consumers of a competitor brand when planning new physical stores. Basically it\u0026rsquo;s any marketer\u0026rsquo;s dream come true.\nOf course, it has just one small problem: it needs permission, and critical mass. You need tens of millions of users using the service, in order to have a meaningful representation.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why Andreas was so adamant when I asked him about his number one goal: \u0026ldquo;Growth. And fast\u0026rdquo;.\nUpdate 2012-05-04: it seems Facebook may agree with me here \u0026ndash; Facebook just announced they\u0026rsquo;re acquiring Glancee. I guess Andrea can scratch off \u0026ldquo;Growth\u0026rdquo; from his list.\n","permalink":"https://wrgms.com/glancee/","summary":"\u003ccenter\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Glancee at SXSW\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/content/images/2014/Feb/glancee.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/center\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy last session of SXSW Day 2 was with \u003ca href=\"http://andreavaccari.com/\"\u003eAndrea Vaccari\u003c/a\u003e, the CEO of the trendy location-based discovery startup \u003ca href=\"http://www.glancee.com/\"\u003eGlancee\u003c/a\u003e.

But despite recent progress with Content Network and YouTube, the marketing community still see the search giant as a way to drive conversion at the bottom of the funnel. In order to move to the next level, Google has to prove they can create emotional connections with consumers.\nEnter Project Re:Brief, just announced during SXSW.\nAccording to Aman Govil, Google\u0026rsquo;s Product Marketing Manager, the idea was to \u0026ldquo;re-imagine iconic campaigns of 4 classic global brands through the lenses of modern technology\u0026rdquo;. The project aims to be a benchmark of what is possible when you have the right idea and the perfect balance between creativity \u0026amp; technology.\nThe brands were carefully selected: Coca-Cola with Hilltop, Volvo with Drive it like you hate it, Avis We try harder, and Alka-Seltzer I can\u0026rsquo;t believe I ate the whole thing. The secret sauce was that they brought back from retirement the original creators of these 4 campaigns, and paired them with digital creatives, so they could re-imagine their original creations, leveraging today\u0026rsquo;s technology.\nIt was fascinating to see people like Harvey Gabor (Coca-Cola\u0026rsquo;s Hilltop, 1971) working with a bunch of twenty-something, and discovering how to use touch screens, mobile, realtime web.\nI had the opportunity to chat with Aman and Drew (the global creative director for the new campaigns) to understand how they pulled it together. Surprisingly, each project took just 2-3 months, and were executed with a relatively small budget (\u0026ldquo;Less than a TV spots\u0026rdquo;, told me Drew). Seems the advertisers were initially resistant to touch iconic pieces like Hilltop, but eventually understood the spirit of the project, and loved the opportunity to work with the original creators.\nWhat is even more fascinating is that not a single can of Coke or Alka-Seltzer was sold because this initiative. Google pulled this off not to help their clients sell more, but to help themseves. The target audience was marketers and agencies, hoping they would talk, comment, write blog posts. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t get more meta than this.\nCheck out more at www.projectrebrief.com, and look for the documentary later this year.\nUpdate 2012-06-22: the full documentary is now available on YouTube.\n","permalink":"https://wrgms.com/rebrief/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/content/images/2014/Feb/google_rebrief-1.png\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the past years Google has been trying to go beyond search, diversifying their revenue sources.
